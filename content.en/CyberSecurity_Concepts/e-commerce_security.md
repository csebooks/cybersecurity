## Introduction

In the era of demonetization and promotion of cashless economy, internet has given a dis- tributed platform to expand businesses thus giving birth to a new form of economy termed as e-economy via e-commerce. In the new economy, the Internet has grown into an influen- tial and universal communication mechanism to assist the consummation and dispensation of business transactions 17. Whereas, e-commerce can be explained as buying and selling of goods and services online by using user interactive GUI platforms. It has revolution- ized the way trade is carried out and today the e-commerce has attained the center stage in the commerce transactions. In other words, amalgam of fast internet and advanced pro- cessors is acting as a catalyst in the developing of multiple e-commerce applications and their usability. The e-commerce popularity’s credit also goes to the convenience provided to the seller and buyer of transacting from anywhere and at any moment. Further, scalable high speed transactions with lower operating costs have led to e-commerce acceptability worldwide. Thus helping to expand the businesses and promoting new form of economy via e-commerce 1.

However, the traditional practitioners of business are going to leave no stone unturned to stop this flooding of e-commerce transactions in the shadow of secure and authentic trans- actions and this lack of trust can severely affect buyers and sellers and they may choose to refrain the use of internet and recrudesce to traditional methods of doing business; as this aspect can turn technology into curse in spite of boon 2. Therefore, in order to create fearless environment for buying and selling on internet, to oppose the above mentioned misconception and insecurity among the clients, and to create a conducive environment for e-commerce security threats the security issues should be properly reviewed and addressed by highly secure, reliable, and authentic e-commerce applications. The countermeasures must be implemented so that it does not discourage use of e-commerce operations.

Above discussion demonstrates the importance of security in the e-commerce for its successful implementation. This chapter explains the issues and problems associated with the security of the worldly goods and transactions in the e-commerce components and activities. Since large amount of public money is involved in the transactions, the role of information security and privacy is not exaggerated in this kind of business. Many issues like Identity theft and cyber fraud are obstacles that discourage customers from getting involved in e-commerce. The awareness on e-commerce security issues has taken a back seat until now; although it should be encouraged as trust and security comes as huge challenges to be addressed to insulate e-commerce system from the set of prevailing attacks. In this chapter we will address different types of application specific security threats, security challenges, and vulnerability issues at various levels of the system. This chapter also aims to study e-commerce security life cycle model and propose comparative analysis of various methods of e-commerce security. Further, it will throw light on to how to deal with various security threats, issues, and comparative analysis of various methods  

 
used in e-commerce security, and performs secure payment transactions in an efficient manner.

## Literature Review

In the domain of e-commerce, secure transaction is one of the key issue that restrict con- sumers and establishments engaging with commerce. A lot of research is going on in the direction of secure and authentic transactions. Some of the work done in the past is discussed below.

Dieter Gollmann et. al 1 has talked about colossal growth of the internet and its services , its active role in commerce territory apart from the academic one. A Sengupta et. al 3 has put forward e-commerce security lifecycle approach, significant standards and laws in e-commerce security. Also various security requirements for the e-commerce system from threats has been identified. M. Ladan et.al 5 has presented an overview of architectural framework of e-commerce and also elucidated various e-commerce security issues and security measures at different levels of e-commerce system.

Raghav Gautam et. al 6 has discussed for proficient payment transactions online secu- rity of the information acts as indispensable management and technical tool. Jarnail Singh et. al 9 has provided guidelines for the security of e-commerce in order to enhance confi- dence of the customer in online transactions. He finds low level security on the web servers of e-commerce and on customers site is the issue to be addressed.

Khaleel Ahmad et.al 15 has proposed a model of e-transaction on the basis of PGP and ECC. This chapter signifies how PGP efficiently handles customer order of information and security of payment using dual digital signature. Theresa A. Kraft 16 et.al has explored latest market trends for e-business and vital role played by e-commerce in the retail market. The modern practices of e-commerce and development of e-commerce has been researched upon and acknowledged.

## E-commerce

E-commerce is extensively used for the purchasing and retailing of goods online. However, transactions made only through digital online fund transfers measures can only be consid- ered e-commerce transactions. With the passing days M-commerce and E commerce are going to play major role in internet based retail marketing. Number of people going to use this technology are going to increase day by day universally. To understand e-commerce security issues understanding of the characteristics of e-commerce is essential which are discussed below.

### Characteristics of E-commerce Technology

Some of the key characteristics of e-commerce 3 are as follows:

1. Automated processing: The generation and processing of multiple payments has been automated by the payer with little effort and cost involved.

2. Immediacy of result: Real time payments because of automation results in payment immediacy  

 
3. Improved accessibility: Accelerated usage of computing and communication tech- nology with suitable software empowers access of payment services even to small enterprises that earlier could only be accessed by large organizations via dedicated network.

4. Global Reach: The new payment system curtails geographical factors; allows busi- ness transactions on cross country basis. It affects certain thrust areas such as extent of payment market place, adaptation of payment schemes to regulatory regimes and many more.

5. Ubiquity: E-commerce can be operated from anywhere whereas traditional business market used to define physical place.

6. Loss of collateral information: Earlier transacting parties used to validate individual payments on the basis of collateral information that they relied upon. Whereas these days new technology waives off or alters collateral information with transactions.

7. Interactivity: In 21st century the two way communication mode is acknowledged between businesses and consumers.

8. New Business Models: They are in place to make use of new payment technologies for disinter-mediation of customers from banks.

### Architectural Framework of E-commerce

Client- server architecture is the base of e-commerce architecture. Client is basically an application which makes use of GUI to send request to server for certain services; server in turn provides the requested services to the client.

In this architectural framework client denotes customer and server denotes business application. This business application is set up on a web server (computer program) which provides services to the customer in the form of HTML pages or files

Two different type of client server architecture of e-commerce are 4: Two tier archi- tecture, and Three tier architecture.

**4.3.2.1 Two Tier Architecture** In this architecture data rests on server whereas business application/logic and user interface rests on client. Client process makes user interface available that collects and present the data on the customer’s computer. Thus, this part of the application is known as Presentation Layer.

Server processes makes availability of interface that frames the data store/ database. Thus, this part of application is known as Data Layer.

The Business Logic/ Application that mostly resides on client side can also reside on server side. The business logic performs various functions of validating data and monitor- ing security and permissions.

**4.3.2.2 Three Tier Architecture** To address the limitation of 2 tier architecture; three tier architecture emerged in 1990s. In this business logic is separated from user interface and from data access. Hence, all three are maintained as independent modules. Thus, in this architecture there are 3 tier involved:

Top tier: User interface services; Text input session; Dialog management: Display management  

 
Figure 4.1 Two tier e-commerce architecture

Middle tier: Process management services; Process development & process monitor- ing; Process resourcing

Third tier: Database management services; Data consistency; Centralized process logic; Localizing the system functionality.

Figure 4.2 Three tier e-commerce architecture

Operation: In e-commerce system client access via internet, sends request which passes a firewall that filters the packets destined for wrong address or wrong ports. Web server treats the request by calling an application which accesses a database server in order to modify, update or read a record or records stored in database and further replies with an HTML page or file. These servers are in addition connected to huge networks 5.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of E-commerce

As in the above section we have discussed many characteristics of e-commerce. The inter- net aids in forming virtual communities which is basically group of people having common  

 
interest. These virtual communities become ideal target market. There are various advan- tages of performing business online from perspective of different stakeholders.

Table 4.1 Advantages of e-commerce

Wider range of choices available

3 Society Promotes cashless economy which, in turn curbs black money

rovides online services in various sectors

Prices of product is kept under check as no middlemen are

involved like wholesalers, retailers etc.

If we look at e-commerce operations form various stakeholders point of view, there are many drawbacks associated with them.

## Security overview in e-commerce

Security is the need of an hour when one operates online as network’s vulnerability to attack is manifold. Information is one of the most vital enterprise assets. For any organi- zation information should be valued and suitably secured 18. Hence let’s discuss about the purpose and different levels of system where security is a prerequisite.

### Purpose of security in e-commerce

1. Authentication: Authentication ensures that only right user has access to data 6. 2. Non-Repudiation: It is a form of confirmation from the user that s/he has indeed

performed an action, so that s/he cannot deny performing that action in future. 3. Privacy: Privacy gives control to the user on how much his/her data can be given/distributed

to third parties. 4. Confidentiality: Confidentiality pertains to that data cannot be accessed by any unau-

thorized person/party. 5. Availability: Availability means that all the data is available to a user s/he is entitled

to, or has the right to access. 6. Integrity: Integrity ensures that data received by a user is the same that was transmit-

ted by sender, that is, no change or manipulation of data has occurred while transmitting data.

7. Encryption: It is the encoding of data in such a way that the data cannot be understood directly by reading it.

### Security element at different levels of e-commerce system

Security of the e-commerce system is of immense significance, thus it must be ensured at various component levels i.e. hardware, software and environment. Ubiquitous computing systems place computing devices everywhere; they will be so prevalent that they will blend into the background. They are also part of the emerging wireless environment 11.

**4.4.2.1 Hardware** The devices that make up the system such as web servers, network devices, and database

servers are critical points of the system and are susceptible to various network attacks. Thus, measures like properly configured firewall should be placed, must be taken. Web servers and database servers should be insulated from various other networks by using DMZ (Demilitarized zone) which is a network that stands between a protected network and an external network. Thus, additional layer of security in the network is introduced.

**4.4.2.2 Software** For the smooth operation of e-commerce software security system requires security OS,

web server software, database software and web browser. Operating system should be configured properly as it is quite vulnerable. In order to fix holes in security, there should be a regular updating of software and routinely released patches.

**4.4.2.3 Environment** Security from environment point of view signals at securing the physical access to net-

work by placing manual guard, CCTV, various logs or other methods.  

 
## Security issues in e-commerce

As we have studied security elements at different levels of e-commerce system, now let’s further talk about various security and vulnerability issues at these levels 5.

### Client level

These days customers tend to get hands on to e-commerce system via different modes i.e. wireless networks, mobile devices etc. These modes are vulnerable to security hazards as an outsider can ears into wireless communication. Thus, there is a need to put password so that an outsider cannot intervene and access sensitive information. In addition, there is always a chance of misplacing the mobile device.

Security issues with respect to mobile devices and wireless networks which further affects e-business are:

Captured and Retransmitted Messages: In this attacker catches hold of message that is of a legitimate user and replays it by altering the message to the same receiver or different one so that the attacker can get unauthorized access and hands on to important information 7.

Eavesdropping: This attack happens on unsecured network and information transmit- ted is also not in encrypted form. Thus, an outsider can ears into vulnerable network and can easily get access to sensitive data.

Mobile device pull attack: The attacker controls the mobile device as a source of propriety data and control information. Data can be obtained from the device itself through the data export interfaces, a synchronized desktop, mobile applications run- ning on the device or the internet servers 8.

Mobile device push attack: The attacker uses the mobile device to plant a malicious code and spread it to infect other elements of the network. Once the mobile device inside a secure network is compromised, it could be used for attacks against other devices or server in the network 8.

Lost Device: A mobile device should always be protected with a password as there is always a chance of its getting lost or stolen and an unauthorized user can access it.

### Front End Servers and Software Application Level

It is observed that in software system there is always a chance of bugs/faults being left by not so skilled software developers. E-commerce security system is expected to be flexible, standards based and interoperable with other systems.

Keeping security advisories and patches updated is quite difficult as communication net- work standards and protocols keeps on changing continuously. Hackers are opportunistic and make most of these vulnerabilities, they make use of viruses and malicious software to infect e-business system and steal customer information

### Network and Servers level

As most of the networks are dependent on other networks which are privately owned and managed, whose security measures are not known to us and its control is also not avail-  

 
able. Inscription aid is used to secure data moving across a network. Network operator is responsible for transporting information securely.

DDoS: Whenever hackers launch a denial of service attack it comes out to be one of the most bothersome security issue faced by e-business today. It is characterized as categorical effort by attackers to avert users from using an e-business system.

Session Interception and message modification: The attacker can transmit altered messages by hijacking a session. He /she can also add a malicious host between client host and server host, which is popularly known as man-in-the-middle. In this case communication in data passes through the attackers’ host.

Firewall Loophole: A firewall is a software or hardware device installed between backend server and corporate network. It is usually implemented at network protocol layer and fails to protect the system at higher protocols. Hackers sense same unfixed firewall loopholes and tries to access price list, email list, catalogs etc.

## Security threats in e-commerce

E-commerce has a tendency to be at a higher stratum for risk and attacks. In e-commerce data are the key to track consumer shopping behavior to personalize offers, which are col- lected over time using consumer browsing and transactional points 19. Server level is the physical place where all of these transactions happens. The server is regarded as the central repository for one’s E-Commerce abode of Business that entails definite website which displays one’s products and services, the database of the customer and the mecha- nism of payment. If any attack takes place on the server, then it proves to be a huge setback as there is a potential of losing everything. Thus, taking the initiative about security takes on a much grander extent now. Now let us discuss various e-commerce security threats in detail 9.

Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS): In this type of attack the availability of a target system (e-commerce) comes in question; as millions of customers are unable to access an online system which is overwhelmed with traffic from multiple sources. In this a botnet is formed in which multiple devices are connected online; these devices tend to generate fake traffic flooding the target system which results in the service being denied to legitimate customer. This attack affects not only the target site but also creates problem of congestion over the entire network (Internet).

It becomes difficult to control or stop the attack as one cannot differentiate between genuine traffic and attack traffic. An attacker may restrain you from getting hands-on e- mail, websites, online accounts that affected computer dependent on10.

DDoS attack comprises of four elements 11:

Victim - The target host who is going to deal with burden of attack.

Attack Daemon Agent Agent programs that perform the attack on victim. Its set up is mostly on host computer but it tends to affect both host and target computer. These daemons tend to gain access and cause infiltration in the host computer.

Control Master Program Coordinates the attack.

Real Attacker Although being the mastermind of the attack, it stays in the background by using the control master program.  

 
Figure 4.3 DDOS attack

SQL Injection: As the name of the attack suggests there must be a sql query which has been inserted while the user inputs the data as the query gets executed at client end, the attack comes into operation. This is one of the most common web hacking technique in which code is injected that might create havoc on database.

SQL injection causes are as follows 12:

Running of software applications that welcome data from unauthentic internet users.

Unable to validate the data.

This data is further used in dynamic SQL query to database backing the application.

SQL injection results in: Spoofing of identity, alter existing data, revealing entire data on the system, access to the data is made unavailable by destroying the data. Become administrator of database.

Figure 4.4 SQL Injection Attack

Price Manipulation: As the name suggests, the original price is manipulated to dif- ferent value. This type of attack is very common on online shopping cart platforms and payment gateways. In this the final payable price is manipulated by the attacker according to his will. In coding, programmer makes use of hidden fields in order to store value of  

 
total item cost; which a hacker can tamper with a value stored on his browser, thus the total amount that is payable is modified by the attacker. Supposedly, the value of an item is mod- ified from Rs.2000/- to Rs.200/-, then it becomes exciting for the customer but misfortune for the seller.

Figure 4.5 Price Manipulation

Session Hijacking: A session is sequence of interactions maintained over a single con- nection between two nodes or end points. As the name of the attack suggests the session control is taken over by hijacker as he/she steals a valid session Id which allows him/her to enter or keep an eye on data or extract it. By changing the route of packets with his or her system an attacker can take part in the conversation of other users 14. It is a combination of sniffing and spoofing.

Figure 4.6 Session Hijacking Attack

Cross Site Script (XSS): In this type of attack a malicious script is attached to trusted websites from compromised site. On adding malicious script the attacker gains access to sensitive information, session cookies etc. It is a special case of code injection. Here, the end users browser has no clue whether it is a trustworthy script or not. Thus, it goes step ahead to execute this script. These scripts change and rewrite the HTML page content.

## Security Approaches in E-commerce

The security of most crucial information of a customer i.e. a credit card data should be of highest priority when transactions are carried online. Security measures that should be ensured in e-commerce architecture are DMZ, firewalls, SSL, SET, Data Encryption, Intrusion Detection, Digital signature and certificates 5.  

 
Figure 4.7 Cross Site Script Attack

Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): It is a special local network that holds sensitive data which is to be saved from unauthorized access. It lies between internet and internal network. It consist of external facing servers ( front-end servers, back-end servers) and firewalls. The job of firewall is not only of protection of front end server but it also filters traffic between corporate network and backend servers. It provides additional level of security as access to internal servers and data via internet in the internal LAN remains unreachable. An external node has access to what is available in DMZ.

Firewalls: When a computer gets connected to internet it becomes open to attack. A firewall is either hardware based or software based; monitors and controls the traffic that comes in and goes out of our computer based on predetermined security rules. It can be configured to let packets from specific IP addresses and ports enter or block them. Thus, it acts as a barrier between trusted network and untrusted network.

Data Encryption: Encryption Technology converts plain text into unreadable format which does not allow third party to view the text. Hence, crucial information credit card number, financial transactions and personal data can be protected. It offers a technique to find out any alteration/modification of data occurred over unsecured network; when the data is received. Data is transmitted over a secure network such as SSL, using secure protocol such as HTTPS.

There are two types of encryption techniques:

Symmetric Key Encryption

Asymmetric Key Encryption.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS): IDS evenly monitor real time network traffic. When it come across an attack signature or a suspicious activity; it becomes attentive and gen- erates alarm to alert the system or network administrator. Sometimes it responds to the malicious traffic by simply blocking the user from accessing the network. It can also pre- vent denial of service attack. It should be installed in front of a firewall.

Digital signature and certificate: It supports e-commerce security features authentica- tion and integrity. A Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is a secure digital key that certi- fies the identity of the holder, issued by a Certifying Authority (CA). It typically contains your identity (name, email, country, APNIC account name and your public key). Digital Certificates use Public Key Infrastructure meaning data that has been digitally signed or encrypted by a private key can only be decrypted by its corresponding public key. A dig-  

 
ital certificate is an electronic “credit card” that establishes your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the Web 13.

## E-commerce security life-cycle model

E-commerce security is a continuous process; it cannot be viewed in modular form as one time provided service. It has become integral part of e-commerce transactions where data is of utmost value as it includes personal information of individuals’ credit card numbers, financial transactions etc. Electronic word- of- mouth has been framed by digital tech- nologies which in turn proposes potential for eliciting credible information that influence consumer behavior 20. It is the responsibility of designer of security system to ensure that system properties are not affected by various security attacks 3.

Steps to design security of system are 14:

1. Model the system.

2. Identify the properties of system that are to be safeguarded when met with an attack.

3. Model the adversary.

4. Ensure the properties are safeguarded under the attack.

Security Requirement Specification & Risk Analysis: At the initial stage information about the following questions is to be gathered:

a . What are the assets of the organization that are to be protected?

b . What are the threats associated with those assets?

c . What are the access control policies?  

 
d . What is operational infrastructure?

e . What are the services required to access the asset?

f . What is the access control mechanism for the services?

Security attributes that are to be protected are authentication, privacy, authorization, integrity.

Security Policy Specification: Security requirement specification and risk analysis re- port is fed as input to this phase; e-commerce security policy is generated as output. Policy are basically high-level-rule-based statements.

Issues covered by security policy are

a . What type of services users can access?

b . What are the information classes present in the organization that are required to be encrypted before transmitting.

c . How the sensitive client data is to be protected?

d . Corporate network remote access is associated with which class of employees?

e . How security breaches is to be dealt with?

Security Infrastructure Specification: Analysis of security requirement specification and security policy specification takes place in this stage of the life-cycle. In this phase one finds out list of security tools that are needed to protect the assets. It is basically the implementation of security policy. Some instances are:

a . Applying password aging and expiration.

b . Demand of complex passwords

c . Recording in a written log all the physical access made to servers

d . Physical access to building is given via badges

Testing E-commerce Security: Several tests are conducted on the system for the fol- lowing purpose:

a . How effective the security infrastructure is?

b . What are the functions of access control mechanism?

c . What operational context is specified?

d . What are the vulnerabilities in the infrastructure to the new threats and exploits

Main objectives of this phase are verification of the following aspects:

a . Security Requirement Specification

b . Configuration of Security tools

c . Gap between proposed security infrastructure and the implemented infrastructure

d . Limitation of the proposed security infrastructure  

 
Requirement Validation: This phase analysis the extent to which security require- ments of e-commerce organization is fulfilled in accordance with security policy and im- plemented security infrastructure. The entire process/cycle starts again if change is incor- porated in the business goal, operational environment and technology. New set of security requirements come in place which stimulates the new cycle of software engineering life- cycle.

## Conclusion

E-commerce is growing at an immense pace. Many technologies have come together to assist propagation of e-commerce these days. This industry is vulnerable to many threats and issues which are being addressed slowly and steadily. To protect one’s place of busi- ness being proactive is the first life of defense against security threat. Educating consumers on security issues is the vital element of e-commerce security architecture which is still in immature phase. Becoming familiar with threats, issues and protecting methods will help in avoiding network vulnerability to outside elements. Ignorance is itself a threat as fraud- sters are in the view of taking advantage of online shoppers committing novice errors. In this paper we discussed e-commerce architecture, security issues, security threats, protect- ing methods for safe and secure online shopping and security engineering life-cycle that helps us to become familiar with various safeguards.

Future Scope: This paper can be used by research practitioners as a base for e-commerce security issues, threats and protecting methods detailed study. Susceptibility of network to attacks and advancement in technology needs customers to be aware of e-commerce secu- rity issues so that e-commerce industry can be insulated from frauds. Privacy concerns of consumers can be entertained by shielding huge amount of personal information posted on the internet and also stress on usable security to aid individuals with security controls that makes sense to them and can be put to use easily 21.
