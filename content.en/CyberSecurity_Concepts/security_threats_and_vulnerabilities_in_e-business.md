Abstract The Explosive Growth of business, science and other areas has lead to abundant data.

We are drowning in data, but starving for knowledge which has brought into concept called as Data Mining. Data Mining is extraction of implicit, potentially useful and unknown knowledge from huge amount of data. Data mining techniques can very well be used for security applications. The permission to access data may cause threat to privacy and security of user’s information. This chapter deeply focuses on the security aspects of data mining and possible solution techniques. Moreover, we also highlight some privacy issues due to data mining like intrusion detection.

## Introduction to E-Business

As the engineering for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) develops, the requirement of more sophisticated business environment is needed. The revolution of the traditional business method results into e-business. Traditional business is concerned with buying and selling of goods by direct mode only, but later there was a requirement to di- minish the labor and effort of the customer to move to the shop; simultaneously enhancing the business process. E-business is the process of buying or selling goods and services electronically. The clients need not to move to the shop to purchase the items physically, rather the user can browse many items from different shops world-wide at his/her fingertip. There are different types of markets like stock market, capital market, money market etc.; but all the market has some similarity in their business process, as they have some sellers and some buyers.

Most of the e-business is carried out via internet nowadays. E-business is a more generic term as compared to e-commerce. It refers not only to information exchanges related to buying and selling but also to servicing customers; and collaborating with business part- ners, distributors and suppliers 4. E-business can have different sub-categories such as e- learning, e-commerce, e-banking, e-governance. e-E-business encompasses sophisticated business-to-business interactions and collaboration activities at a level of enterprise appli- cations and business processes. E-business processes are integrated end-to-end across the company with key partners, suppliers and customers and can respond with flexibility and speed to customer demands and market opportunities.

### Benefits of e-Business

Sometimes the user wants a product which is at some far distance apart. Consider for example the consumer and the product are in different countries. In this case, the user has to go abroad to purchase the particular product, which is a time consuming job; as well as this requires a lot of money and a lot of strength. In e-Business this problem is resolved. The major benefits of e-business are,

1. Maintaining the consumer data is easier. This data can be used to enhance the business process by using data mining.

2. Shopping malls can use the consumer demand and habit, to rearrange the products inside the shopping mall, by using association mining technique.

3. Globalization of goods and services is possible. The user can get the goods or services across the world apart from location.

4. Time is saved (as compared to, visiting shops door by door) simultaneously surfing for the product and service is possible from various position of the globe.

5. Users can compare prices for the same product from various locations at the same time.

6. User can get more options to choose a product or service. In traditional business user has limited choice within some hundreds to thousands; but in e-business system, user can choose among some thousands to millions products worldwide. So this is a situation which is called “surf more-choose one”.  

 
7. Marketing can be done in lesser time as compared to shopping physically. For exam- ple if someone from India wants a product which is in Africa, then he/she must not move to Africa; which is more time consuming, he/she can get the product within one or two weeks online.

8. No need of carrying money all the time, which is quite risky. The user can pay online.

### Business revolution

In ancient era, when there was no e-business, people were using several marketing ap- proach, to sell their product and services such as sales promotion, brochure etc. The gen- eral business approach is described as follows.

The first category of business involved directly from manufacturer to consumer or em- ployer to workers. Here the business is small enough that the number of employees in the total business was no larger than a family and the manufacturer and the seller was the same person.

In the second category of business, one seller is there in between manufacturer and the consumer. The job of manufacturer is to produce the products whereas sellers deal directly with the customers. In this process also, the business is a small scale business and the manufacturer is hardly able to satisfy a few numbers of customers.

The concept of wholesaler and retailer were involved in the third category of business. The manufacturer produced the products and sells it to the wholesaler. The wholesaler then sell the products to the retailers, the retailers sell their products to the sellers, and finally the sellers deal with the customer. Next the distributor came into existence, who only caries the non-competing goods.

This type of business is not applicable for the modern era where the demand is more with different variety. The customers want speed delivery of goods at their doorstep; low (reliable) price across the globe; good product; good customer support. The manufactur- ers also use much money to sustain in the market because many competitors are there to compete. A complex business process is that, which includes manufacturing the products, market research, promotion of the products in the print and online media etc. The business structure must be scalable, reliable in order to satisfy their customers.

Traditional business structure:

Figure 3.1 Product flow structure in traditional business

E-business is the common mode of business now days. Though the traditional approach exists, but in this digitized era, the system of business is almost automated through internet. Customers can choose products online from any business store like Amazon, Flip kart. The price of product is also paid online by using online banking, debit card, credit card etc. Then the product will be shipped to the consumer at the doorstep. The general process of e-business is shown below.

## Security issues in e-business

Business system are of four types, such as B2B (Business to Business), B2C (Business to Consumer), C2B (Consumer to Business), C2C (Consumer to Consumer), C2G (Consumer to Consumer). These e-business systems have the common components like consumer, payment option, system information, customer information, product information, etc. The business system must provide security to each of its components. There are two types of security issues present, in the business system such as security threats and vulnerabilities.

Data mining is the key area in the 21st century, which is applied in almost every field of the technology. According to Robert Herjavec 5, there is more investment in cyber security than the health care. This is the case, that the health care providers are more cautious to protect the patient data. Similarly in e-business, the data repository must be safe, because data is as much precious as economy, and sometimes more.

According to Richardson 6 in 2008, the attacks by means of bots, DNS attack, pass- word sniffing, data stolen from mobile devices are increasing tremendously. Denial of service, financial fraud, Malware threat constantly exists in the network. According to Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) 7, in 2017 the data breaches increased by 45% from 2016 to 2017, and this is more than any previous years.

E-business has some strategy and process 2. E-business includes the transmission of goods and services from supplier to consumer via internet. There are many threats like disclosure of confidential information to modify the information, which results into loss of data and economy. The malicious user, always try to find new methods to bypass the security and privacy of the e-business system.

Let an example of a consumer, who bought a product from store “S”, when the person tries to pay for the product, some unauthentic person collects the debit card or credit card information of the consumer. Now the unauthentic person can use the consumer data for personal use.

Similarly there are many threats in e-business system which is described below.

### Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are the weaknesses of the normal functioning of the system that could be misused to impair the system or in worst case it can shut down the e-busyness system. The vulnerabilities may create some open ports; by means of which, it is possible to attack the system. Some of the vulnerabilities are, accounts with weak password which can be easily guessed; programs with unnecessary privileges like administrative privilege; weak firewall configuration etc. The vulnerabilities are discussed in section 3.3.  

 
### Security Attacks

Security attach is any action which disrupts the security of information or intellectual prop- erty. Security attacks in the flow of e-business are a major problem. The attacks can be categorized mainly into two categories as Active attach and Passive attack. Passive attacks will not modify the data which is sent from sender to receiver rather it senses the pattern of data which is unsafe in e-business system. Active attack is associated with the modifica- tion of message content. Release of message content, traffic analysis are known as passive attack; whereas masquerade attack, Replay, Message modification and Denial of service attacks are known as active attacks.

Masquerade attack: Masquerade is a type of attack where the attacker pretends to be the authorized user. The attacker sends message as like the authorized user. This process can be used to access all the data from a user, pretending that the attacker is the authorized person.

Replay: It involves the repeat or delay of data by the malicious attacker. The detailed study of replay attack and its prevention mechanism is discussed by Malladi et al. 8. This type of attack can access all the personal information of a user, when provided to third party.

Message modification: The unauthorized user modifies or reorders the legitimate mes- sage from the sender, and sends it to the receiver as if the sender sent the message directly to the receiver.

Denial of service: This attack implies the disruption of the particular services resulting abnormal or unusual behavior of the system.

Some other types of attacks are there in network security, which is applicable for the e- business system such as, Spoofing, Fabrication, and Sinkhole etc. which are well explained in 4.

### Malware as a threat

The vulnerabilities in the e-business process include some malicious programs which work without the proper concern of the user. There are malware which are considered to be the serious issues for the e-business system. Many anti-malware systems exist to provide security to the system from malwares. Although they are working quite well, still malwares are able to evade them in many cases. Most of the anti-malware engines use signature based detection. Now many researchers use data mining approaches for malware detection which provide much stronger accuracy. Some of the malwares are discussed in section-4.

## Common Vulnerabilities in e-Business

### Phishing

Generally phishing attack is done by spoofed emails, which is claimed to be original email message from the authorized person or organization. If the user enters any sensitive infor- mation in the location provided by the unauthorized person, the information is sent to the unauthorized person, who can misuse them.  

 
### Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-site scripting 9 is possible, if the input-output validation is not checked for the user; and the trust level of the user on any website. Cross-site scripting provides a web form, to enter the sensitive information of the end user. The sensitive information includes the credit card or debit card number, the card expiration date, pin (password) etc. If the user enters the details in the web-form, then the information is carried to the third party or the designer of the page. This type of attack is hard to be detected.

## Threats in e-business

Many threats are there which can affect the e-business system. Malwares are the common mode of disrupting the smooth functioning of the e-business system. The e-business system has two parts, one is the electronic money and other part is the information. This is a NP-hard problem to provide security to the e-business system. Some of the malware are discussed below.

### Ransomware

Ransomware is a sinister malware, which encrypts the user data from user system; and asks for money (ransom) to get the data back. The attacker used the bitcoin mechanism in order to evade from detection. Ransomeware is a foremost threat to the e-business in 2017 because several infections were pointed out in this year. According to key findings of 1, the Wannacry and Petya ransomware infection for organizations rises 29%, 30% and 42% in the year 2015, 2016 and first half of 2017. The report cites a quote as, “The drop-off in 2017 may indicate that the gold rush mentality among cyber criminals is beginning to abate somewhat, leaving the market to be dominated by professional ransomware gangs.” In 2016, 470000 infections were blocked whereas in the first half of 2017, a total of 319000 ransomware attacks have been blocked.

### Spyware

Spyware is a malicious computer program which works without the knowledge and con- sent of the user. Spyware programs are usually hidden among other programs or can be unwittingly downloaded to the user system when certain websites are visited; this concept is known as drive by download. The user is unaware of the working of the spyware. Spy- ware can collect the sensitive information from the user, for which it was created. The sensitive information may be the user credentials, debit card and credit card information, banking details, user browsing habits etc.

In modern computing it is noticed that, the spyware targets the windows as well as android environment. Mobile phone with android operating system is common among the people. Maximum number of people among the mobile users is not expert in information security. So they are unaware of the spyware.

Spyware is of various types like adware, keylogger, botnet, dialer, spam, rootkit etc. The categorization is done on the basis of the function, of the families. These spywares are used to hamper the e-business system.

Adware: As the name suggest, adware is especially designed for advertising purpose. Adware is not only meant for advertising, it can also be misused to act like a spyware. Very  

 
often it pops-up some sort of ads, but at some instances, it can steal the user information like a spyware.

Keylogger: Keylogger is also a dangerous threat in e-business because it has the ca- pability to collect the key strokes entered on the user interface. Hence it can collect the username and password of the user.

Botnet: Botnet creates a network of bots, which affect the e-business system in terms of collecting user information and sometimes to use the user resources like memory and processor. Botnets work by means of the remote command of the botmaster.

Internet URL logger and Screen recorder: URL loggers track websites and pages which are visited online by the user. Screen recorder can take a small gray scale image of the screen of user computer, every time it changes. The images then can be stored or transmitted to the third party without the user consent.

This type of spyware starts, when the system starts. If the user is connected to internet, then it starts recording all the screen shots and store in a specific memory area which is normally unseen to the user. By using this technique, the third party can collect most of the valuable information of the user like, password. Sometime it acts as a keylogger as a user may use onscreen keyboard to type a password. Each time, when the user clicks on the onscreen keyboard, the screen is recorded and sent to the controller of the spyware.

### Worms

Worms are the self-propagating and self-replicating malware. Worm is not considered to be dangerous, but it can use the resources like memory and bandwidth of the user. This may lead to failure in the business system.

### Trojan Horse

According to the traditional definition of Trojan Horse, it seems to be harmless or legiti- mate program, but actually it is not. It is sinister in the sense that, it is hard to be identified. It can create a backdoor to the user computing system or it can steal the user personal data as per the program.

## Prevention Mechanism

E-business system is a sensitive environment, where the data is given more priority than economy. So some prevention mechanism is needed to handle the security threats, vul- nerabilities and attacks. The prevention mechanisms can be categorized in the view of the user and in the view of security personnel.

Prevention mechanism in the view of user,

Strong firewall configuration must exist.

If possible, data must be encrypted before sending over the network.

Strong password must be used.

Anti-malware software should be used with updated malware definition.

Prevention mechanism in the view of security personnel,  

 
Physical protection of computers.

Network system management and security.

Email control security.

Set proper access control.

Use data encryption techniques.

Digital certificate.

Backup the data, which can be recovered when required.

Wireless communication security must be there.

## Conclusion

Though e-business has the ability to digitize the payment and communication system which is quite easy and speedy, but it has some flaws. Security must be maintained in the commu- nication system as well as the standalone system. The precautions and safety measures are to be maintained in order to maintain the security. Many researches are ongoing to detect the malware threats and to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the communication system, but still it is considered to be an NP-hard problem. Data mining and machine learning methods are proved successful to handle the e-business system. But still the business system is not fully automated, which should be fully automated in future.
