Abstract “War” is the most dangerous play of humans when their resources are under threat

which then continuously evolved through history for greed. After huge losses in world war Humanity’ was restored with diplomacy. War is initiated when emotions like fear, greed encroaches the minds of a society. Fear is triggered basically because of lack of resources for living a peaceful life, questions in mind like what if your resources are threatened by a nearby society as they are growing faster, what if the other nation is having more money and arms that they might enslave your society. Greed happens after the nation reaches a sta- bility and wants to be super power. Armed warfare in todays world has been reduced with diplomatic efforts, but the fear of reduced resources and greed for money is still visible, the resources are now becoming digital all over with the development of technologies like 5G, internet-of-things, smart phones, smarter cities (etc.) but so are cyber-attacks like Wan- naCry ransomware, Equifax, NotPetya, BadRabbit (etc.). With everything connected to the internet, the internet has become a battlefield connected with all nations civilians plac- ing them in the war field unknowingly. This connectivity is a bigger threat as it can cause massive devastations with digital economies on the rise and with everyone, everything, even your brains connected to the internet and with the ever-encroaching war emotions in some people’s hearts its evident that a war is coming, a cyberwar!

## Introduction

Since the age of computer revolution first began with cheap and powerfulpersonal com- puters reaching each and every household in the world, the risk of the computation tool being misused by the whims of bad people also increased and there have been significant cyber-attacks in the time period so far and is continuing with new connections extending the cyber battlefield.

The very first generation of threatening viruses released by Bob Thomas with BBN Technologies in 1971 is Creeper 1. The originator was not self-replicating initially. It is injected into a system, once infected, it will display a message “I’M CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN”. It has corrupted DEC PDP-10 computers, the reputed mainframe com- puters in 1968, operating on TENEX operating system. Creeper led the development of its adversary named Reaper, one of the world’s first anti-virus softwares. Early definitions of so called viruses became displaying a sentence in a third party personal computer without the attackers own presence.

The act of displaying message turned out to display a poem with the evolution of Rich Skrenta’s Elk Cloner in 1981. Elk Cloner 1 set Apple II computers as its target. It is actually a boot sector virus spread via floppy disk as a Game. The game when booted the 50th time, closes it and displays the poem of Elk Cloner. Elk Cloner actually didn’t create any harm to the victim but

it corrupts the disk. Skrenta added a signature byte to disk’s memory to point out that it is already corrupted. The computer needs to be rebooted every time to get rid of cloner.

Further, Skrenta decided to spread cloner without the use of floppy disks by creating a boot sector virus that would display message automatically in an Apple II machine. The cloner is spread via a hard drive which modifies the boot sector codes. When the machine is booted the next time, Elk Cloner makes its presence in the system even without starting any application or game explicitly.

After being used to display messages as prank in other’s machines, the business came into play with viruses. In 1986, Farooq Alvi and Ajmad Farooq Alvi, the brothers from Pakistan worked to avoid the customers of their computer store to use illegal copies of their medical softwares. The evolution of boot sector virus from Skrenta, led them create Brain boot sector virus 2, where the name Brain being the name of their computer store. It became the first virus threat to MS-DOS. The brain boot sector virus is injected into the machines which uses illegal copies of their software. It places the virus of 5KB in the boot sector of floppy disks which slows down the system. It cannot be detected as it does not harm the system. Rather displays a message stating not to use pirated softwares and provides their contact to get rid of the infection.

In 1988, the experiment conducted by Robert Tappan Morris from Cornell University to determine the size of the Internet led to the establishment of first worm distributed over the Internet. The worm for experimentation was released from MIT. The worm once downloaded into a system, infects the system by slowing it down. The actual exertion of determining internetgauge changed to a virus affecting system because of the nature, the Morris worm 3 spread over the systems. The worm is more likely to be run in the same system many times, slowing it down every time and finally making it unusable. Hence self- replicating worms are more harmful even now-a-days. The unintentional experimentation of the graduate student became responsible for about $10 million damage stated by U.S. Government Accountability office.

The worm was washed out by Clifford Stall, who surveyed that the Morris worm in- fected about two thousand computers in just fifteen hours. It is also stated that disinfection  

 
took about two days. Morris’s colleagues stated the survey to be a cooked-up one. Robert Morris was sentenced to three years and was fined $10,500 along with cost of his super- vision. Morris worm was actually an ignition for the security personals to concentrate on Internet security

With the slow relief from accidental worm of Morris in the Internet, there entered an intentional injection of a worm named Michelangelo 4 in 1991. The attacker is Roger Riordan, an anti-virus expert from Australia. Michelangelo deceived itself to be a destruc- tive virus, which is not according to reality. Yet another boot sector virus. It actually did a little harm to the systems.

Michalangelo has been considered one of the threatening viruses in 1990s mainly be- cause of its media hype. Michelangelo has its practice of infecting the first 17 sectors of every track in the infected hard disk on every March 6.Seen so far, boot sector viruses seem to be more threatening. A boot sector virus affects the Master Boot Sector (MBR), which runs every time the computer starts. MBR controls the boot sequence and also determines the partition in which the computer boots on. Once the virus can successfully infect the MBR, then the computer boot will fail and the contents inside the memory will be lost. Boot sector viruses are hard to remove; hence the better solution is to prevent them by appropriate verification of external drives for viruses before being injected into the system. Good anti-virus software does the job.

After a decade of Michalangelo’s hype, in 2003 January, a huge computer worm threat- ening the internet world of causing denial of service attack was discovered. The attack requires the prerequisite knowledge of the loop hole in ancient Microsoft SQL. IP address spoofing over a particular UDP port can cause buffer overflow and destruct normal service of the SQL server 5. David Litchfield from Microsoft conducted a proof of concept and fixed the issue of this SQL Slammer attack. The issue was submitted to Microsoft Secu- rity Response Center and a patch was developed to counterfeit it. In the next Black Hat, Microsoft released the patch and requested every SQL users to add the patch for security. The POC was studied by researcher Michael Bacarella released publicly in Black Hat. The attacker implemented it and released over the Internet. About 75000 servers that were not patched were affected in just 10 minutes. The victims were not deemed to confess the attacker for the virus because it is the victim’s mistake of not adding the patch.

After passing the era of using viruses to threaten and demolish computers, there evolved an era of destructing targeted computer sources using viruses. The dot product was named Stuxnet 6, which has the capability of attacking the programmable logic controller (PLC) ofindustrial control systems. PLC is responsible for taking logical decisions by monitoring the inputs and produce appropriate output in an automated machine. Stuxnet was born in 2009 at Kaspersky Lab. Stuxnet attack systems running windows, which actually is not a kind in PLC. As PLC is a proprietary machine-language based device, the virus initially captures the system running the PLC. Then it infects the Siemens SIMATIC WinCC, a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and human-machine interface (HMI) systems. As these program PLC, infecting them, destructs the proper programming of PLC. The impact is resulted in an improper automation process by PLC, disrupting the industrial process in a large scale. Stuxnet initially spreads in three systems, each of which has the capability of infecting another three and so on.

Stuxnet has a record of causing a substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program. The worm could be wiped away by a suitable anti-virus program.

Once Stuxnet reached its supremacy, a so-called extended version of Stuxnet is devel- oped not with the same notion of destructing industrial control systems, but with the aim of gaining information from and delete recent information in those systems 7. The attack  

 
was created by Unit 8200 by 2009, the Israeli Intelligent Corps unit. The unit captures sensitive information that are encrypted and transferred as signals.

The worm creates a file, with a prefix ˜DQ, in the infected system. Hence the model is named Duqu. Duqu also targeted the Iran nuclear deal, but with a goal to gather sensitive information, instead of demolishing it. The worm is very difficult to predict because of its passive nature unlike stuxnet. The behavior let it prevail in Kaspersky lab for a long time without being detected. Once the threat was discovered in 2010, the worm program codes kept added in anti-virus softwares.

The recent attackers started concentrating on espionage rather than sabotage. The result was the development of a modular computer worm named Flame 7 in 2012. The worm is also known as Skywiper, witnessing its ability to wipe away the contents in the infected system. Kaspersky lab and CrySys lab called it the most tedious malware they had ever seen. The wiper acquires the system in the similar way of its ancestors: Stuxnet and Duqu, by affecting the rootkit functionality. Flame is capable of spreading over LAN or USB stick. It can capture user activities: record audio, capture screenshots, key stokes and network traffic. Skype conversations also find a place in the list. The collected data and other files can be sent the control server for analysis by attackers. The worm targeted sources in Iran, Syria and Israel. Kaspersky entered the program with its competitor to have yet another late precaution of the espionage worm.

## Ransomware attacks

Ransomware continues to be the most threatening form of modern cyber crime 8. Acquir- ing the computer on the whole through email attachments, drive-by download, malicious pdfs and exploit kits, and then making an open blackmail of asking the owner to pay, to get back the computer as before, is the yarn definition of ransomware. The ware may be locker, where the entire system is locked, not being able to use or it may be crypto, where some dedicated, sensitive files is locked and access is denied. The lock or access denial is released only after amammoth demand of bitcoins is transferred to the hackers as a fine owing to the innocence of the business man. Also the ransomware provides no assertion for providing the key to decrypt the lock; it did for the files or the system, even after paying the fine. Listed below are the siblings of ransomware, each becoming more threatening and blackmailing.

### Petya

One of the family members of encrypting ransomware is Petya. The malware was dis- covered in March 2016. Petya infects the master boot record (MBR) of Windows based systems. The propagation is via email attachments to victims. Once petya corrupts the MBR, it prompts a restart of the system. Upon restart, the corrupted boot sector encrypts the Master File Table of the computer. Petya then bids for a fine amount that must be paid as bitcoins to get back the old state of the system. Several patches came from Microsoft for the victims’ sake. But the over fitting, makes the next worm version cleverer. The new version of Petya, named as NotPetya 8 by Kaspersky, pretended itself as the Ukraine tax software update and infected thousand of Systems around 100 countries. Pharmaceutical giant Merck gave $300 million to NotPetya for its innocence.  

 
Figure 5.1 Petya Ransomware

### WannaCry

The most devastating and undisputed attack in the history infecting several thousands of banking sectors, law and other government agencies is WannaCry Ransomware in May 2017 \[8, 9\]. The attack took advantage of the exploit in the implementation of Microsoft’s Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. SMB, responsible for authentic inter process com- munications and message transfer, is developed by U.S. National Security Agency. The loopholes in the protocol were released as EternalBlue by some brokers. This led to the implementation of the WannaCry (WannaCrypt). WannaCry once reaching a computer searches for the Kill Switch if not found. The option is used to shut down the computer immediately, if it is not possible to do so in the usual way. Then it encrypts the computer in its usual fashion as what Petya did. WannaCry in addition attempts to exploit the SMB vulnerability to spread to random systems on the internet. The modern versions, instead of encrypting computers as a whole, is encrypting dedicated files and then demanding bit- coins for a decryption key. The demand proposal is $300 in bitcoin within 3 days or $600 in bitcoin within 7 days.

Figure 5.2 WannaCry Ransomware

Marcus Hutchins discovered the hardcoded Kill Switch step of WannaCry. Then the spread of the worm is severely reduced. Several variants of the worm came with dis-  

 
tributed attacks with the intention of spreading offline. Researches were carried out on the encryption process of WannaCry. The Windows Operating Systems were updated to get rid of unauthorized encryptions.

### Locky

The worm was discovered in March 2016. But it became more vulnerable in 2017, by spreading via emails with an attachment containing malicious macros as word document. It used a social engineering technique by using the sentence Enable macro if data encoding is incorrect’. If a user enables the macros, then the malicious macros get installed. It is followed by encryption of files with particular extension and the demand of bitcoins for a key. Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center lost their patient data to Locky 10. The data were recovered with a cost of $17,000 ransom.

Several ransomware attacks came in 2017 with similar encryptions and demands. The attacks targeted government agencies, industries having potential data. Ransomware being a huge cyber attack in history is not the part of technology as a whole. It evolved with many shadow brokers and insiders leaking the bugs in softwares.

Figure 5.3 Motive of the attackers over years

As depicted in Figure 5.3, initially worms had the motive to threaten others or to show the technical competency to people. Later, the formula went into business to punish illegal users. Then worm itself went for illegal usages. The aim is for money, steal/ destroy data. Today, cyber attacks became business to earn money. They are the millionaires and the criminals, using the technology in wrong side. The attackers seem to use the innocence of the victims, as the researchers coming up with patches and anti-versions to restrain from most of the worms are not reaching users immediately. This reachability deficiency is used by most of the attackers. In future, cyber attacks are expected to create life risks for users. Black mail for money now can become for life then.  

 
## Are the Nations Ready?

As the world nations are moving towards a digital economy evolution, the army that pro- tects the citizens of the nation on land, air, water now have to move to digital medium as cyber army to protect the netizens as well. The warriors of the digital war field have been increasing over the years, the cyber warriors are not just people employed by the nation military, there are rogue cyber hacktivist groups in a nation with an agenda for hacking other nations or their own. Let’s see the state of each nation in the world.

INDIA: There are different intelligent agencies and government agencies in India re- garding cyber security, like the

Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) which has Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (ICERT).

Intelligence Bureau like Central Bureau of Intelligence,

National Intelligence Agency,

National Technical Research Organization

Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO)

Apart from these there are private agencies or NGO regarding cyber security like Indian Cyber Army 11 which is an autonomous association with ethical hackers in it, and it also acts as a resource center for the Indian national police and other intelligence agencies.

BANGLADESH: Even though Bangladesh is a smaller country, the national cyberse- curity strategy of Bangladesh document 12 says how effectively the nation is equipping itself for maintaining cyber security in their country. The strategy tries to improve cyber security of the nation by

Improving the cyber-crime laws through globalized laws, authorizing government en- tities

Improving national infrastructure on cyber security through a national security frame- work, awareness spreading, preventive measures, tracking and fixing vulnerabilities

Improvie organizational structures to respond to attacks through collaboration of stake- holders, national cybersecurity council, incidence management national level, collab- orating with private sectors, skill training citizens.

Apart from legal government entities, there are hacktivist groups in Bangladesh like Bangladesh Cyber Army. And there have reported news online about hacking activities of Bangladesh Cyber Army like attacks on Indian websites and leaving demands to Indian officials 13.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The United states of America is one of the pow- erful nations of the world with the biggest army among other nations. USA has the biggest army budget in the world. Its investment has also been in cyber security of the nation. As per the world economic forum, the pentagon has announced to increase in staff under cy- ber security and also the US cyber command has been involved in launch of attacks against Islamic state 14.

In 2007 the United states launched the Stuxnet worm to advert Iran’s nuclear program. This shows the power of network security breach, what if this attack was more malicious to  

 
attack another country without permission. This case shows the importance of security in army sector, as weapons are connected to the cyber world, the probability of any countries weapon system to become compromised has increased.

Privacy has also been a big concern in the cyberworld. There have been tensions around the world when Edward Snowden, former NSA exposed the surveillance activities of the US intelligence NSA and also global intelligence agency 15, this created awareness and panic in people all around the world.

RUSSIA: As per the world economic forum there has been beliefs of many military cyber attacks on Georgia and Ukraine being originated from Russia. Russia has been involved in many cyber security controversies, there have been a controversy over 2016 US elections results, which the intelligence experts suspect Russian hackers involvement 16.

There have been many attacks that happened in cyber world were traced backed to Russian IP addresses which puts Russia in a controversial space in the cyber security world 17, attacks on Estonia, France, Germany ,Kyrgyzthan, Ukraine was suspected to be done from Russia.

PAKISTAN: Pakistan is also honing its cyberwarfare capabilities for years, it has been suspected for various attacks like Operation Arachnophobia, Operation Hangover. 18 Operation Arachnophobia is an investigation done by fireeye a security company to in- vestigate a Bitterbug malware that was targeting Indian computers. Operation Hangover was attack from India that targeted Pakistan, the response from Pakistan is the Operation Arachnophobia which targeted Indian computers.

CHINA: China the worlds most populous nation with a population count of 1.4 billion. China has one of the biggest army in Asia.

There has always been tensions with cyber attacks and china, even google has closed their search engine facility in China. The number of internet users in China is large as with the population but so is the growth in the number of hackers in the nation. Its been reported by Symantec that a third of the malicious software in the world originates from China. Many of the Chinese hackers are driven by patriotism and call themselves Honker. Once when the biggest search engine of China Baidu was hacked with a message that the Iranian Cyber army has hacked it, the Honkers union retaliated by hacking Iranian websites. There are also other Hacktivist groups like the Red Hacker Alliance, (etc).

There have been multiple accusations against China on hacking other nations like Aus- tralia, Canada, India and the United States of America.

GERMANY: The German Government is developing a major program to protect its computer networks and supply systems. A new institution - the National Cyber Defence Centre (Nationales Cyber-Abwehrzentrum) - will be responsible for detecting potential threats, analysing them and coordinating the necessary measures to disable the threat. In addition, a National Cyber Security Council will be established 19.

IRAN: Iranian hackers attack on a Saudi oil company is a notable influence of Iran in cyberwarfare domain. There are different Iranian hacker groups which are acting ag- gressively in attacking like the Rocket Kitten, which in turn creates tensions within cyber radar.

ISRAEL: There have been alleged reports that Israel has hacked Kaspersky lab belong- ing to Russia to get intel about nation state attacks research conducted in it. In the 2006 war against Hezbollah, Israel alleges that cyber-warfare was part of the conflict, where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intelligence estimates several countries in the Middle East used Russian hackers and scientists to operate on their behalf. As a result, Israel attached  

 
growing importance to cyber-tactics, and became, along with the U.S., France and a couple of other nations, involved in cyber-war planning 20.

In war between Israel and Syria, an air attack dubbed Operation Orchard was launched by Israel on Syria. The U.S. industry and military sources speculated that the Israelis may have used cyberwarfare to allow their planes to pass undetected by radar into Syria.

UNITED KINGDOM: It’s been reported in sites like Wired that United Kingdom has hacked undersea cables of Yahoo and Google to decipher the data traffic 5, and also there was a hack organized by United Kingdom Government on Belgacom for data monitoring of traffic.

In the UK, the National Cyber Security Centre, part of the signals intelligence agency GCHQ, has been taking steps to protect public bodies and companies. It has been advis- ing them on how to deal with these lower-level criminal attacks that, it says, “affect the majority of people, the majority of the time”. “There is much hyperbole about the capa- bilities of cyber actors” says Ian Levy, NCSC’s technical director. “Certainly, some nation states invest huge sums of money and significant highly skilled resources in their cyber programmes and use those for various things that are detrimental to the interests of the UK” 16.

NORTH KOREA: North Korea is believed to the reason for various cyber attacks on United States, South Korea. There was a CNN news report which informs the direct in- volvement of North Koreas hacker army attacking banks worldwide. The hackers were traced back to North Korean IPs, the hackers stole 81 million dollars from Bangladesh banks. Experts have speculated that this money could be used for the country’s military budget. The security groups found the similarities in the malware attack on Bangladesh banks and the attack that happened in Sony, which was also suspected to be done by North Korean hackers.

There are already tensions with the nuclear tests being done by North Korea, and with their development in cyberwarfare, there are one to watch for in the future.

## Conclusion

Thus, we could see that in history there has always been disputes between various nations of the world. The only difference is that the weapons nature has changed from stones, swords, guns and now computers. In the first section we could see that how various ma- licious attacks can impact organizations and countries on a large scale. Some attacks are done for fun, some for money, some for vengeance, these attacks are done both by single person on a small scale and also by Country on another country. So, we saw a compilation of how various nations are progressing in the development of cyberwarfare capabilities in the next section. We could evidently see that each nation is key to build their cyber army to protect themselves and to compromise other nations security system. It is essential that the international intelligence and peace agencies must form treaties in order to avoid any catastrophic cyber-attacks. Because in the future a coordinated massive cyber-attack might destroy the world when everything gets connected.
