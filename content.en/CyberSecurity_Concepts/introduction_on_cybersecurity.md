**Abstract**
In a world reigned by speed and perfection, technology relies primarily on computer science. Be it a simple act of sending an email or a critical act of conveying billions of dollars, almost everything is merely a click away. The world of computer science keeps people engaged in activities like gaming, website surfing, social media, banking, digital citizenship etc. spanning its grip upon all domains like hardware, software, network, data etc. Because so many activities rely on computers, they attract criminals, which ultimately leads to cyber crime, which could be as elementary as a basic hacking or as elaborate as ransom-ware attacks or financial cyber crimes. The consequences may vary from loss of personal or sensitive information to loss of massive amount of money. Thus the need for ensuring cybersecurity is paramount. In this chapter, we will take a look at the concept of cybersecurity, its causes, consequences and principles. The idea of cybersecurity is not only limited to small firms and educational institutions, but also spreads across various industries and government making it one of the most significant areas of study. In the past, certain objectives have been proposed to safeguard such critical cyber infrastructures. Certain standards, guidelines and practices find their place in cybersecurity frameworks to ensure that the cyber infrastructure and architecture is secured. Since the operations are multiple as well as insightful, they must be carried out by accountable personnel who are usually given roles in the cyber infrastructure depending on their nature of their work such as the security administrator or the incident response team. We will look forward to some of the roles in this chapter. The nature of cyber crimes over the last few years has changed drastically owing to the change in motive behind the crimes, tools and tech- niques involved and the overall consequences. We observe the contrast between traditional computer crimes and contemporary computer crimes over the last few years. General evo- lution of cyber crimes has led to internet based risks affecting businesses, organizations etc. which have the potential to harm liability and properties. The concept of cyber in- surance is recent and promises coverage when organizations suffer internet based risks, which we have essayed in this chapter. In the later part of the chapter we will familiarize ourselves with the concept of security policies and various security models that enforce them. Few security models like the Bell La Padula and the Biba model will be discussed in this section. Further, we will acquaint ourselves with the concept of network neutrality and human rights as they go hand in hand. Keeping in mind the risks and after effects of cyber crimes, we will also explore the the legal aspect of cyber crimes by analyzing the concept of computer forensics. Some best practices pertaining to countermeasures for information warfare have also been discussed.

## Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity may be defined as the ability to defend against and recover from cyber at- tacks. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cyberse- curity is the ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks 1. The entire cyberspace constitutes of several interdependent networks of the information sys- tems infrastructure which could be the internet, telecommunications network, computer systems, embedded systems and controllers. Thus cybersecurity is concerned with critical infrastructure, network security, cloud security, application security, internet of things and several other domains where the need to ensure security is paramount.

1. **Critical Infrastructure:** Security in critical infrastructure deals with cyber physical systems and real world deployments. Industries like automation, aviation, healthcare, traffic lights , electricity grids etc are prone to cyber attacks like eavesdropping, com- promised key attacks, man in the middle attacks and denial of service attacks 2.

2. **Network Security:** Network security deals with measures and concerns to protect information systems. It guards against unauthorized intrusions and protects usabil- ity and integrity of network and data. Cyber attacks on networks could be passive like port scanning, wiretapping and encryption, and active like phishing, cross site scripting and denial of service attacks.

3. **Cloud Security:** Cloud security takes into account several control based technolo- gies and policies to protect information, data applications and infrastructure within the cloud. Since cloud is a shared resource, cyber attacks on clouds may lead to data breaches, system vulnerabilities, malicious insiders, data loss and shared technology vulnerabilities. Some attacks on the cloud computing environment are account hi- jacking, phishing, denial of service attacks and compromised credentials.

4. **Application Security:** Security of an application is ensured by mitigating security vulnerabilities. Since an application development has several stages like design, development, deployment, upgrade and maintenance, each stage is susceptible to cy- ber attacks. Common attacks pertaining to web application security are cross site scripting, SQL injection, buffer overflows and distributed denial of service attacks. In mobile applications, attacks like spywares, botnets, ad and click frauds and malware infections take place.

5. **Internet of Things Security:** Internet of things (IoT) consists of computing, mechan- ical and digital devices with unique identifiers, capable of transferring data over the network without human interference. IoT security safeguards these connected devices and networks in IoT. The attacks include spywares and botnets.

The CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad is the unifying attribute for cy- bersecurity which is used to evaluate security of an organization using the three key areas related to security namely confidentiality,integrity and availability. The three attributes have specific requirements and operations.

1. **Confidentiality:** Fairly similar to privacy, confidentiality ensures that information is accessed by authorised personnel. The idea is to prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorised people. Attacks on confidentiality could be credit card fraud, identity theft, wiretapping,phishing and social engineering. User IDs, passwords, encrypted data, Access Control Lists (ACL) and policy based security measures evade attacks against confidentiality.

2. **Integrity:** Integrity ensures consistency, trustworthiness and accuracy of data. The idea is to prevent modification of data by those who are unauthorised to do so. It also ensures data authenticity and non repudiation. Some attacks on integrity are man in the middle attacks, session hijacking attacks and salami attacks. Establishing user access controls, checksums, data encryption and hashing are some means to ensure data integrity.

3. **Availability:** Availability refers to timely and reliable access to resources. The infor- mation concerned should be readily accessible to authorised personnel. Some attacks against availability are Denial of Service attacks, SYN attacks and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) flood attacks.

Cybersecurity revolves around the human and operational side of technology. It takes into account 3Ps namely people, plan and practice to reduce.

1. **People:** The main idea about people being involved in cybersecurity is to prepare human resources against cyber threats and for data protection. It is not uncommon for organisations to be victims of phishing. Educating masses and awareness efforts in form of classroom trainings, emails, tips and tricks can lead to constituting such a compelling. Environment.

2. **Plan:** In order to respond to a cyber incident, there should be a plan that answers significant questions like ’how to communicate with the staff during the incident’ or is there a technical way to deal with some issue’. Using a plan could assist in recov- ering data and restoring operations. It can guide, establish protocols and organize the approach to certain responses.

3. **Practice:** Testing of plans requires exercises. Practicing refers to preparing the team with exercises in order to identify weaknesses in the plan. Exercise may incorpo- rate hypothetical situations, series of clues, implementations, decision making and response processes.  

 
## Cybersecurity Objectives

The concept of cybersecurity strives towards maintaining a secure cyberspace so as to safeguard the critical infrastructure. To recover from cyber incidents and attacks, there should be appropriate response, resolution and recovery. A legal framework ensures secure cyberspace. The following are a few objectives that lead to prevention from cyber threats and protection against cyber attacks.

1. **Prevent threats:** In order to prevent threats, it is important to analyze the attacks and ensure designing, deployment and operation of required Network Control Protocols (NCP). Threat indicators must be identified and certain incident reporting guidelines must be established. Adopting best practices and identifying malicious technology combined with research may be used to avert certain threats.

2. **Identification and System Hardening:** One of the primary objectives of cyberse- curity is to identify threats in order to harden the system. The process ensures risk assessment and adoption of security measures. The purpose of system hardening is mitigate certain risks associated with security. Sometimes advanced system hardening approach is used, which incorporates reformatting of hard disks and installing only specific programs into the system.

3. **Conduct operational, architectural and technical innovations:** Introducing dy- namic approaches towards cyber risk management protects cyber infrastructure from specific cyber attacks.

4. **Prepare for contingencies:** The idea of contingency planning is basically prepared- ness for cyber attacks. It may contain policies, best practices, procedures and recovery plans.

5. **Allocation of information:** The information that is supposed to be circulated in the entire system must be effective. Cyber threats, vulnerabilities and incidents could be reported by issuing alerts. The information may be successfully distributed among several platforms.

6. **Specialized Security Training:** The workforce must be equipped with specialised security training. The information and services must be provided to the joint federal partners so that workforce is strong enough during cyber incidents.

7. **Strengthen system fault tolerance:** Fault tolerance of a system may be computed by performing vulnerability assessment. High assurance systems may possibly withstand cyber attacks.

8. **Reduce vulnerabilities:** Several security practices assist in reducing vulnerabilities. Patching, use of firewalls and using strong passwords can prevent malicious access to the systems.

9. **Improve usability:** The term usability is defined as the degree to which something is easy to use. Usability requirements may be incorporated into the systems along with trusted technology.

10. **Authentication in cyberspace:** Verification of the identity of a user or process is an important process in cybersecurity. Depending on the device, one factor or multifactor authentication may be deployed. Authentication supports what we have, what we are and what we know.

11. **Automate security procedure:** Automation leads to efficiency, better prediction of behavior and faster execution. Appropriate implementation of automation leads to prevention of cyber attacks. Automation can correlate data, promote prevention quicker than the spreading of attacks and identify network infections.

12. **Guarantee interoperability among devices:** Interoperability is the ability of systems to coordinate in order to work together or across organizations. Ensuring interoper- ability leads to information being distributed effective in the organization.

13. **Highlight unfavorable events in cyberspace:** It is important to highlight unfavorable events in cyberspace so as to find solution in order to prevent the systems from being vandalized. Information regarding the cause, extent and impact of unfavorable events may be listed for future use.

14. **Introduce security measures:** By introducing security measures, one can detect cy- ber attacks ,prevent them and correct them. Some security measures are network segmentation and use of firewalls, secure remote access, access controls, password protection, ensuring training programs and defining policies 3.

## Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Internet Architecture (NIST)

Since cyber attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated, there is a need to intro- duce standardized practices to ensure security.The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) incorporates certain policies, standards,guidelines and best practices to encounter cybersecurity issues 4. This framework is divided into framework core, implementation tiers and profiles.

1. **Framework Core:** The framework core comprises of certain schemes leading to spe- cific outcomes. It may be in form of functions, categories, subcategories and infor- mative references.

- Functions- In order to secure systems and respond to attacks, the five basic func- tions are to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover, which we will be dis- cussing about later in this section.

- Categories- Different functions have corresponding categories for identifying dif- ferent operations and activities. For eg. in order to protect, one can make use of access control, software updates and anti malware programs.

- Subcategories- Categories with specific goals are termed as subcategories. For eg, the process of software updation could have specific operations like proper configuration or manual updation of machines.

- Informative References- Informative references include policies, standards and guidelines. For eg, certain steps that require manual updation of Windows system.

2. Implementation Tiers: The following are the four tiers of implementation

- Tier 1 or Partial Implementation handles organizational risks inconsistently due to ad-hoc cybersecurity infrastructure.  

 
- Tier 2 implementation deals with risks,plans and resources to protect cyber infras- tructure at a deeper level than partial implementation.

- Tier 3 or the Repeatable Implementation can repeatedly tend to cyber crises. Poli- cies may be implemented in the same level and cybersecurity awareness can min- imize cyber related risks.

- Tier 4 or the Adaptive Implementation is responsible for detecting threats and predicting issues with respect to the security infrastructure.

3. **Profiles:** Cybersecurity Framework has some specific goals. Profiles summarize the status of an organization’s cybersecurity. Multiple profiles in a cybersecurity frame- work ensure identification of several weak spots that are a part of the cybersecurity implementation. They can also support connection among functions, categories and subcategories to resources and risk tolerance of organizations.

As discussed before, we will now take a look at the functions of the framework core. They are as follows

1. **Identify:** Identification refers to development of understanding in order to manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data and capabilities. The identify function has the following categories.

- Asset Management- Identification of data, devices and systems that assist an or- ganization for business purposes.

- Business Environment- It prioritizes the objectives, mission and activities of an or- ganization. The information plays a key role in decision making for cybersecurity roles, responsibilities and risk management.

- Governance- These are the mandatory guidelines essential for managing an orga- nization’s environment and identify the cybersecurity risks.

- Risk Assessment- The organization must be able to infer the risks related to its operations and infrastructure.

- Risk Management Strategy- Several constraints, tolerances and assumptions affect security risk decisions.

2. **Protect:** Organizations must be equipped with several defense mechanisms during a cybersecurity event. Ensuring controlled access, awareness, training, proper network configuration, deploying protective tools and technology, etc can ensure protection of cybersecurity infrastructure and systems. The following are the few categories for protection.

- Access Control- Authorised users may access devices , processes, activities and transactions.

- Awareness and Training- Awareness and training to the employees of the organi- zation along with policies and guidelines can ensure protection from cyber issues.

- Data Security- Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data should be main- tained throughout its lifetime.

- Information Protection- Policies, procedures, guidelines and processes can protect information.  

- Maintenance- Maintenance of system could be performed using certain policies and procedures.

- Protective Technology- Policies, procedures, agreements along with technical so- lutions lead to system security.

3. **Detect:** To identify cybersecurity events, proper measures must be adopted by orga- nizations. Monitoring and threat identification are few ways to detect security issues in systems. The following categories pertain to detection.

- Events and Anomalies- Analyzing the events in timely manner can ensure detec- tion of anomalous activities.

- Monitoring- Monitoring the system at different intervals can assist in identifying issues and also for verifying the effectiveness of solutions proposed.

- Other detection techniques- Several processes and procedures may be tested to detect malicious behavior in a system.

4. **Respond:** In case of cyber incidents occurring, organizations must be able to contain the impact. Chalking out response plans, establishing communication lines, collecting and analyzing information are several response strategies. We look at a few categories.

- Response Planning- Execution of processes and procedures to detect cybersecu- rity events.

- Communication- Information and response activities across the organization can be coordinated if communicated properly.

- Analysis- Analyzing data ensures proper response and recovery.

- Mitigation- Several events which have the potential to cause security issues must be mitigated from the system. The cyber incidents and their after effects must be mitigated.

- Improvement- Analyzing the current and previous detection-response activities, the future response activities can be greatly enhanced.

5. **Recover:** Cybersecurity events have the potential to affect services and capabilities of systems. Therefore organizations must introduce effective strategies or recovery plans to restore the system. The following are some categories to do the same.

- Recovery Planning- Execution of recovery processes and procedures and mainte- nance leads to timely restoration of systems affected by malicious events.

- Improvements- Upgradation of current processes and procedures leads to improve- ment in future systems for recovery.

- Communications- Communication within an organization ensures coordination of restoration activities.

## Cyber Crimes

### Overview

Cyberspace takes into account communication over computer networks. The information travelling over networks could be sensitive, thus attracting adversaries to steal information. Hence it is important to ensure that not only the network is secured, but so is the informa- tion being transmitted. The need for cybersecurity arises because the cyberspace is not free from attacks. Any criminal activity which involves a computer, network or digital tools is termed as a cyber crime. Activities like hacking, spamming, phishing, identity theft, unau- thorised access etc are termed as cyber crimes whereas computers, laptops, mobiles or any digital devices which perpetuate cyber crimes are termed as objects of crime. An individ- ual, group or organization that commits cyber crimes is called a cyber criminal and they usually makes use of computer as a tool or target or both. Some cyber crimes are discussed as follows.

- Computer as a Target: These are the cyber crimes that target computers, networks or digital devices. Cyber criminals perpetuating suh cyber crimes are technically insightful. Targeting a computer could lead to gaining unauthorised access of the targeted system, vandalizing the target system or using the target system to diffuse further attacks. Computer systems may be targeted by viruses and malicious codes through emails, attachments and website links and also by mere denial of service attacks.

- Computer as Tool- A computer may be used as a tool to perpetuate cyber crime. Rather than affecting a system, the main goal is to target an individual. This technique exploits human weaknesses wherein the adversary conducts phishing attacks, scams, thefts, spams and may also propagate illegal or obscene content.

- Cyber warfare: Politically motivated attackers are responsible for cyber warfare. Also known as cyber war, these kind of cyber crimes are promoted by the internet and usually target financial and organization systems by sabotaging their websites or per- forming sophisticated espionage.

- Cyber terrorism: Cyber terrorism is also led by politically motivated attackers which target computers, information systems, data and programs, usually resulting in vio- lence among different groups. They may be caused by Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), viruses, worms, malwares, denial of service (DoS) attacks, phishing and hack- ing techniques.

As we know, computers and digital devices are portals of information and stimulate information exchange all over the world. They are also responsible for communication and data reserves. Using a computer for committing a crime is easy, quick, inexpensive and sometimes untraceable, thus making cybercrime one of the simplest ways to commit crime. To commit a crime in the cyberspace, the cyber criminal has to consider some measures. They are discussed as follows.

1. Step 1- Know your Target - In order to launch an attack, an adversary must know the target system that has to be considering. Knowing a target system refers to collecting data about the target system involving the machines, components and how secure the system and the network is. Performing a research on a target system may take a few weeks to a few months and it provides the adversary information as to how secure the system is, for the adversary to prepare an attack.

2. Step 2- Secure your System- In this step, the adversary tries to identify vulnerabilities in his own system and network and tries to secure his own system. By now he has enough knowledge about the security of the target system.

3. Step 3- Setup test network - Before launching attack on the target, the adversary will build a test network and try to test the target by trying to access it remotely or pinging it to see if its active.

4. Step 4- Hammer the Target System - In this step the target system is hammered. The hacker the system, create a backdoor to get into the system, gain remote access, gain unauthorised access, crack passwords and get superuser privileges.

5. Step 6- Cover the Tracks - This is the final step of the attack where the adversary has to cover his tracks so that administrator is not aware of the system being attacked. The activities performed by the adversary may be saved in form of logs and other files. The adversary needs to make sure that the activities are not registered, he may have to delete files or reset certain configurations.  

 
### Traditional Computer Crime and Contemporary Computer Crime

In the previous section, we have highlighted how cyber criminals offend a computer system or components in order to carry out a cyber crime. It is believed that the first cyber crime took place in the 1820s. Eventually with the expansion of computing, sophisticated cyber crimes started making their appearance. Cyber crimes can range from basic scripting at- tacks to substantial malware attacks. There is also variation in the attack strategies. In this section we will take into account the evolution of cyber crimes i.e. how cyber crimes have grown from the last few years (traditional cyber crimes) to where they are right now (con- temporary cyber crimes). Although different cyber crimes were conducted all throughout the given following timeline, we consider the crimes that were paramount in the respective years 7.

- 1820, Series Repetition- The trivial cyber crime involved repetition of series of steps for weaving a special fabric which in turn threatened the livelihood of people involved in the textile industry. It was believed to be an act of sabotage 8.

- 1867, Interception- The act of interception causes information sent by a sender to be intercepted by unauthorised user who may modify the contents of the information to another form. The user may also exploit the information for malicious processes.

- 1920, Organised Crime- Organised crimes are defined as illegal activities that are administered and chalked out by powerful groups. Cybercriminals may use anonymi- sation, encryption and virtual currencies to carry out such attacks.

- 1961, Phreaking- The act of phreaking refers to breaking into telecommunication systems. The motive is to obtain free calls by tampering with the internal operations.

- 1965, Telemarketing scams- This is another fraudulent activity that exploits the use of telephones. Regarded as an act of deception, it involves the adversary trying to obtain private information of victims.

- 1970, Computer Hacking- Computer Hacking is the unauthorised invasion to a com- puter or network and is concerned with modification of system hardware or software in order to accomplish a goal.

- 1971, Creeper Virus- Creeper virus is one of the earliest known viruses that happened to affect a computer system. It could potentially locate a computer in a given network, pass into the computer and print files displaying a message. It could start over again and again.

- 1980, Denial of Service and Extortion- A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is launched to prevent the legitimate users from accessing a service. This is the result of the ad- versary sending out multiple requests to the server, in order to consume the server resources which leads to the server not responding to legitimate users. Cyber Extor- tion takes place when the adversary pressurises or threatens to damage business if they are not paid a ransom. Usually, they try to look for the loopholes in the security architecture of the business organization and try to exploit it.

- 1985, Funds transfer Fraud and ATM fraud- Funds transfer fraud takes place when money is transferred, paid or delivered due to fraudulent computer activity or manip- ulation of electronic data. When an ATM card is used for deception, it leads to ATM fraud. The adversary may use the card to withdraw money by virtue of PIN based transactions.

- 1986, Espionage- Computer systems and networks can be relied upon for gaining unauthorised access to sensitive information. This information may be restricted to the government or corporate organisations. Internal data, intellectual property, client information and marketing intelligence information are some of the sensitive infor- mation.

- 1990, Child Exploitation- One of the insidious uses of computers is that of child exploitation. File sharing, webcams and streaming videos often lead to exploitation. Key threats for child exploitation have been identified to be Peer-to-peer networks, darknet networks and live streaming technology.

- 1993, Botnets- Botnets refer to a cluster of private computer systems which may be controlled as a group. They are usually infected with malicious softwares and are used to launching attacks, flooding networks etc.

- 1995, Online piracy, Identity crime and spam- online piracy or internet piracy refers to illegal copying of softwares using internet. It may lead to copyright infringement. Identity crime or identity theft refers to impersonation of someone else’s identity. It is done deliberately and leads to identity fraud. Spamming refers to sending of irrelevant or unsolicited messages, usually for the purpose of marketing.

- 1997, Cyberterrorism- Computer systems and technology may be used by politically motivated cyber criminals in order to cause disruption. It is done to intimidate, harm or threaten a government or a part of population.

- 1998, Cyberstalking- It is a crime wherein an attacker intimidates a victim by means of electronic communication. The attacker may send emails, instant messages or use social media as a platform to stalk the victim. It can also be done by monitoring, identity theft, threatening or gathering information about the victim to harass them in future.

- 2002, Phishing- It is a fraudulent activity wherein an attacker masquerades as a trust- worthy individual, but sends malicious files in form of attachments or links, such that when clicked, the victim’s system gets compromised. It could lead to the system behaving inappropriately or obtaining the login credentials of the user or system.

- 2003, Wireless Vulnerabilities- In a wireless environment, nodes are mobile unlike wired environment where nodes are static. This leads to wireless environments being more vulnerable than wired environments. The threats could be in form of rogue access points, bluetooth attacks, wireless driver attacks and configuration weaknesses.

- 2006, M-commerce attacks- Electronic commerce that rely on mobile phones have their own set of disadvantages. Installation of stealthy softwares (rootkit) could affect mobile phones, steal information and reroute calls. Digital certificates may be stolen. Unsecured WiFi threats, viruses and malwares and further aggravate the situation. Encryption hacking can steal private information and electronic eavesdropping cannot be ruled out.

- 2009, Cloud Computing attacks- The cloud environment also harbors certain vulner- abilities leading to cloud computing attacks. Attacks like Denial of Service (Dos), Malware injection, side channel and Man-in-the-Middle are prevalent in cloud com- puting.

- 2013, RFID attacks- RFID attacks are usually physical attacks. They are in form of system jamming, radio signal blockage and RFID tag disabling. They also support eavesdropping, replay attacks, sniffing and spoofing.

- 2014, Credit Card Fraud- credit card fraud involves a payment card, usually credit or debit as an illegal source in order to conduct a purchase. The main idea behind credit card fraud is to purchase items without actually paying or gaining unauthorised funds belonging to an account. They have been known to result in huge financial losses.

- 2015, Data Breach- Data breach refers to the act of sensitive data being accessed copied, transferred, viewed, stolen or used by unauthorised users. The sensitive infor- mation may be in form of credit card information, social security numbers, healthcare information etc.

- 2016- DDoS- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack sees to it that multiple jeopardised systems attack a target. This target could be a website, server or network resource. A denial of service attack is launched for the users of the target. The mes- sages, connection requests and packets utilise the resources of the target and compel it to slow down, crash or shut down. The idea is to deny any service to the otherwise legitimate users.

### Combating crimes

In the previous subsection we have familiarized ourselves with several cyber crimes. We now know that cyber crimes are a result of vandalizing the system and can be performed by gaining unauthorised access into them, viruses, worms, frauds, data breached, spams and scams. Different cyber crimes have different prevention and detection techniques. We have already discussed how timestamps and logs collectively provide information about unauthorised access. In this section we will focus on ways to combat the cyber crimes. The following are some effective ways.

**1.5.3.1 Securing Networks** 
Network Security is the biggest concern while combating cyber crimes. The network may be a part of a small enterprise or may be a robust enough to span across multiple organizations. It may be simply wired or wireless, in either ways it is vulnerable to cy- ber crimes. The easiest ways to secure networks would be hardening the systems such that firewalls are installed or unnecessary ports are blocked. The firewall should be stable enough to protect services in the demilitarized zone as well as different critical servers. The wireless networks must ensure encrypted access points along with the Service Set Identifier (SSID) being hidden or changed to a less suspicious name. Other security mea- sures available for securing the network are in form of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) which can work collaboratively to ensure greater security. They can identify potential threats to the network by constantly monitoring and identifying events to log information about them. This information may be sent to the management.

**1.5.3.2 Incident Response Team** 
The Incident Response Team in concerned with combating cyber crimes in the sense that they receive information about data leakage, analyse the events and respond accordingly. The team may consist of security professionals like incident handlers, vulnerability han- dlers, penetration testers, reverse engineers etc who perform security operations. The cy- ber crimes usually handled by the Incident Response Team mainly revolve around viruses, worms, unauthorised access, Denial of Service attacks etc.

**1.5.3.3 Detecting Malwares** 
Malwares work by using the principle of getting installed into a system and then enabling a backdoor so that confidential information may be retrieved. It is important that a malware is detected before a system is infected. Several malware classification techniques are adopted for the same. Network Based Malware Prevention technique analyses the net- work traffic and blocks any malware that is found. End-Point Based Malware Prevention technique has a software sitting at the end point that analyse the traffic that moving into and from the machine. It detects the malware and also any application that runs it

**1.5.3.4 Authentication and Authorisation** 
Identity theft is one of the most common cyber crimes. The process of authentication may be used to validate the identity of a user. The process of authentication relies on what we know (something like a PIN or a password), what we have (like an access card) and what we are (biometrics). Authentication may be single factor or multifactor, keeping in mind the required security level. Authorisation specifies the privileges or access rights of an individual for system resources. Cyber crimes that involve masquerading or unautho- rised access of data may be combatted using these techniques.

**1.5.3.5 Filtering** 
The internet is full of malicious content ranging from websites to emails. Web filtering is important so as to prevent the users from clicking into websites that contain malicious con- tent or inadvertently enter their personal information. Phishing and spamming emails often incorporate within themselves malware which when downloaded can sabotage a system. Spam and Email filtering can prevent such crimes.

**1.5.3.6 Best Practices** 
In order to combat cyber crimes, certain best practices must be adopted. They ensure that the crimes are not only detected but also prevented to some extent. Some of the best practices are as follows.

- Updating the current version of software. This process leads to elimination of bugs present in the code and performs the required patchwork.

- Using antiviruses blacklists viruses and malwares based on signature detection tech- nique.

- Updating the password once every few months, but not very frequently. The idea is that an attacker may hack into a system, hash the password and run a brute force to gain access to the system and install a backdoor.

- Not using the same password across multiple platforms. Many applications are con- nected these days. Using same password can encourage a hacker to break into all the applications that share the same password and gain important information like banking details.  

- Using a Virtual Private Network ensures encrypted content.

- Backing up your data can ensure that even if malwares like ransomware are launched, the data is safe. However it is important to ensure that the data is encrypted and protected.

- Using the principle of least privileges allows every new account to have least privi- leges, the privileges may be escalated as desired. The idea is to not allow too many privileged users to access data. It may not only lead to insider threats but also external threats in case the account of an employee is compromised externally.

- Using multi factor authentication is based on using a combination of authentication techniques, which is difficult to be cracked and provides additional layer of security.

- Cybersecurity awareness about untrustworthy websites, social engineering, malicious links and spams.

- Use passwords that contain Uppercase, Lowercase and Special Characters. It makes exhaustive search difficult.

We have observed the diverse nature of cyber crimes. Hence it is difficult to say which method could be prioritised over the other. To ensure security, collaboration of different techniques is encouraged. Security techniques along with best practices can ensure system security and detect potential threats.

## Security Models

Security models are based on the concept of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Different security models tend to different concepts and describe how security must be implemented. It also takes into account what subjects can access a particular object or what objects could be accessed by subjects. Since different models have different capabilities, they could be applied to any system keeping in mind the requirements and functioning of the system. In this section we will come across several security models 9. They are as follows

1. **State Machine Model**- This is the basic security model which captures the function- ing of the finite state machine. The number of states, the transactions involved and the actions taken are observed by this model. The idea is to monitor the status of the system so that it does not transit to an insecure state. A particular state will have all the permissions of the subjects accessing the objects. The security feature preserved is integrity. This is ensured by the fact that each state transition function is tested to verify that the current state will not be compromised in order to maintain the integrity of the system.

2. **Information Flow Model**- The State Machine Model extends to the Information FLow Model and further to Bell LaPadula and Biba Model. The model incorporates objects, transition and lattice states. This model is adopted to prevent any unautho- rised information flow, thereby preserving the security feature Availability. The model is capable of blocking restricted information flow between subjects and objects. How- ever, information flow in the same classification level is highly encouraged.  

 
3. **Non Interference Model**- Proposed by Goguen and Meseguer and as per the name, the Non Interference model ensures that subjects and objects at different classifying levels do not interfere with each other (higher or lower). It is impossible for data to cross security boundaries i.e. if a subject at higher level performs an action, the state of the subject at lower level cannot be changed. An interference attack takes place when an entity has the potential to retrieve information and is capable of inferring information it is not entitled to based on the clearance level.

4. **Bell LaPadula Model**- It is a mathematical model that follows multilevel security policy using the mandatory access control and promotes confidentiality. Different subjects may have different classification levels like top secret, secret and confidential. The subjects must be authenticated with respect to their security clearances to access an object that lies at a different classification level. The Bell LaPadula model follows certain rules which are as follows

- Simple Security Property, wherein a subject that belongs to a particular level of confidentiality cannot read information pertaining to a higher level of confiden- tiality, often being termed as no read up’.

- Star \* Security Property wherein a subject belonging to a particular level of con- fidentiality cannot write information pertaining to a lower level of confidentiality, often being termed as no write down’.

- Strong Star \* Property wherein subject may not be allowed to read/write to an object pertaining to higher/lower sensitivity.

Biba model has its own limitations. Security issues like covert channels are still a challenge. It is ideal for models that promote confidentiality, but cannot enforce other security features like integrity and availability.

5. **Biba model**- The Biba Model was a lattice-based model build in order to ensure integrity. It is concerned with data flow from one level to another. The rules followed by Biba Model are

- Simple Integrity Property wherein subject at given level of integrity may not be allowed to read an object at lower level of integrity.

- Star \* Integrity Property wherein object at a given level of integrity may not be allowed to write to an object at higher level of integrity.

- Invocation Property wherein it is prohibited for a subject at a given level of in- tegrity to invoke a subject at higher level of integrity.

Although this model was developed after Bell LaPadula model, it only addresses the concern of integrity, without highlighting confidentiality and availability. Moreover it does not take into consideration any kind of internal threats, rather focuses on the external ones.

6. **Clark Wilson Model**- The Clark Wilson Model was developed to ensure integrity in commercial systems. It introduces the concept of separation of duties classifying data into highly protected constrained data item (CDI), and Unconstrained data item (UDI). in this model, data is accessed by subjects by means of application and requires auditing. The model incorporates user (subjects or active agents), transformation procedure (read/write/modify), CDI, UDI and Integrity Verification Procedure. The model ensures integrity by permitting only authorised users to modify information, separation of duties and consistent transactions. The access control triple consists of user, transformation procedure and CDI, to ensure integrity and avert fraud. It allows modification of data only appropriately. Integrity Verification Procedure check validity of the state such that data cannot be tampered. Moreover it also logs all the changes.

7. **Take Grant Model**- This model featured the confidentiality aspect by introducing four basic functions- grant, revoke, create and take. The subjects with take rights are permitted to remove the take rights from other subjects. Subjects with grant rights are permitted to grant right to other subjects. Subjects with create right are permitted to give create right to other subjects whereas subjects with revoke right may revoke the right from other subjects.

8. **Brewer Nash Model**- It is somewhat comparable to Bell LaPadula model and is often termed as Chinese Wall model. It is used to address the problem of Conflict of Interest (COI). The access controls provided by this model change as per the user’s previous actions. The idea is the restrict the flow of information in such a way that it cannot flow causing conflicts of interest. The subject is permitted to write to an object only if the subject is incapable of reading another object in a different data set.

9. **Other Models**- Few other security models introduced were Graham-Denning Model- This model highlights certain protection rules wherein each subject is acquainted with an owner and controller. The protection rights are as follows

          - Securely create an object 
          - Securely create a subject 
          - Securely delete object 
          - Securely delete subject 
          - Provide read access rights 
          - Provide grant access rights. 
          - Provide delete access rights 
          - Provide transfer access rights
          
- Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Model: This model is concerned with creation, deletion, modification and accessing of subjects and objects. It is based on the fact that a finite set of methodologies are used to modify access rights of a subject on an object.

- Lattice Model- In this model, a lattice structure represents security levels for ob- jects and subjects. It is based on information flow between subjects and objects. A subject may access an object if security level of subject is same or higher than that of the object. It incorporates multilevel and multilateral security.

## Computer Forensics

Cyber crimes know no bounds and can range from basic data theft to cyberstalking. Foren- sic science involves use of specific techniques with respect to criminal justice and highlight collection, scrutinization and analysis of physical evidence. In computer forensics, there is investigation and analysis in order to garner and conserve physical evidence (to avoid tampering), such that it can be presentable in court of law. A documented chain of evi- dence is maintained which specifies the issue with the computing device. The Locard’s Exchange Principle states that the entity responsible for crime will bring something to the crime scene and will also leave the crime scene with something 10. This could be used as a forensic evidence.The investigators performing forensic analysis follow specific pro- cedures to conduct forensics and make sure that the device is isolated so that it cannot be contaminated anymore. They also make a digital copy of the data encompassed in the de- vice, so that if the procedure affects the device, the backup data is still available to retrieve evidence. A number of techniques are deployed by the forensic experts to perform the analysis. They may seek hidden files and folders, or try to retrieve deleted, encrypted and damaged data. The evidences found if any, are documented accordingly. Thus conducting forensic analysis is a step by step procedure. The following steps are adopted for the same

1. **Policy Procedure and Development**- Forensic data can be very sensitive. If not han- dled with utmost care, this data may be compromised easily. Thus a set of policies and guidelines must be referred to in order to in order to carry out forensic investigations. This may include information about storage, retrieval, authenticity and documenta- tion of the forensic device. The policies may also adhere to certain laws pertaining to enforcement agencies since they involve investigative protocols for carrying out the forensic process. It is also important to handle the evidence properly once informa- tion has been retrieved. Before carrying out any digital investigation, all details must be laid, case should be studied rights and, warrants and authorization should be stated clearly.

2. **Evidence Assessment**- Assessment of evidence is very important for conducting forensic analysis. Assessing potential evidences gives a clear idea about the cyber crime and the potential steps that must be taken further to gather information about the evidence. If a person is accused of committing crime related to data theft, foren- sic experts will analyse hard drives, email accounts, social networking accounts etc. to assess important information to be used as evidence. Before an investigation may be carried out, it is mandatory that the forensic investigator establishes the types of evidences retrieved. This would give an idea about how to proceed further and how to preserve such data. The source and integrity of data are then studied before it can be classified as an evidence.

3. **Evidence Acquisition**- Acquiring evidence is one of the most critical phases in the forensic analysis. It is important to document events before the process of evidence acquisition, during the process and also after the process. The documentation usu- ally would incorporate detailed information about the process, hardware and software standards and specifications, the systems involved and investigated. Removal of stor- age devices, retrieving confidential data using boot disks and ensuring that the ev- idence has been successfully copied and transferred are all documented during the evidence acquisition process. It is important that the process is performed legally by authorized professionals. The chain of evidence includes information about the custody, analysis, control and disposition of the evidence.

4. **Evidence Examination**- Forensic analysts use a combination of techniques to per- form forensic analysis on potential evidence. They may search for data, files and folders using specific keywords, or try to retrieve files that have either been hidden or deleted. They take into account the timestamps and logs of the files and folders in or- der to find out suspicious files that may have been tampered or encrypted. Information such as when and where the file was created, if it was downloaded or uploaded could give enough information to the investigators about the network activity. It could reveal information about the directories, servers and other computer systems, providing the investigators with significant information. Evidence examination is also done in col- laboration with investigators, lawyers and other experts to gather enough information about the evidence.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**- Documenting and Reporting all the procedures in- volved in forensic analysis ensures that the integrity of data is preserved all through- out the process. It makes sure that proper policies and guidelines have been followed while carrying out the analysis. It is important to document the entire process, failing which the validity of the case could be compromised. Accounting the actions per- formed in either digital format or archives ensures authenticity of the findings and makes it easy for security researchers to convey where and how the evidence was redeemed.

**Famous Computer Forensics Case Studies**: Computer forensics can be traced back to approximately four decades. During the 1980s, computer forensics was used as evidence to solve some famous crimes. Some of them are as follows

1. **BTK Killer Dennis Lynn Rader**- The BTK Killer case witnessed a council president of a church, Dennis Rader as a murderer who is believed to have killed at least ten people. His method of murder involved Binding, Torturing and Killing, hence the acronym BTK. While committing the murders, he would send peculiar notes to the police providing the details of the murder. Sometimes the clues would be in form of poems, puzzles and pictures. One such note was a breakthrough for the police to identify him as the murderer. Rader sent the police a floppy disk containing docu- ments created on a Microsoft Office. The document was analyzed by forensic experts using the forensic tool Encase, and it was found that the document was last modified by someone names “Dennis” at Christ Lutheran Church. Upon investigating, it was found that the president of the church council was Dennis Rader. When a background check was performed involving the DNA of the accused, Rader was found guilty and the BTK murder mystery was finally solved after thirty years 11.

2. **Maury Troy Travis**- Maury Troy Travis was accused of killing seventeen women 12. To identify the accused, in this case, the police did not have to perform tests or use standard forensic tools.A post dispatch reporter received an anonymous let- ter which highlighted a murder and along with the letter was a map showing a part of West Alton, with an “X” mark to show the locus of the dead body. As the body was retrieved, the map was found to be retrieved using the Internet. The investiga- tors looked at the records for the said map, and found that only one computer had requested the map location. The Internet Protocol (IP) address and the name of the user requesting the map traced back to Maury Troy Travis.

3. **Scott Tyree-Scott** Tyree kidnapped a teenager named Alicia Kozakiewicz and sent her picture using the Yahoo Messenger to someone in Tampa, who happened to realise that the girl was missing from her home. The man contacted the investigators and provided them the details and screen-shot of the Yahoo Messenger. The name Scott Tyree chose for his messenger was ’masterforteenslavegirls’. The IP address of the sender was traced. The next thing to do was obtain the information of the sender from the carrier Verizon. The address was that of Scott Tyree 13.

4. **Corey Melton**- The home computer of Corey Melton seemed to be infected with malware, which made him approach the Best Buy technology expert. It was found that certain malware had the capability to reattach itself to the movies, which incorporated child pornography. Melton was sentenced to prison 14.

## Cyber Insurance

Technology these days solely relies on the use of computer systems. This perpetuates cybersecurity issues across all domains like the hardware, software, network, cloud etc. To get work done ranging from minute data entry to complicated simulations, people de- pend on computer systems. This puts the devices at cybersecurity related risks. Organiza- tions across the entire globe store sensitive data, which if breached could cause prodigious losses, questioning the reputation of the organizations. Thus organizations rely on some- thing called as cyber insurance. Cyber insurance is also known as cyber risk insurance or cyber liability. The main idea behind cyber insurance is to assist an organization reduce cyber risks by neutralizing costs pertaining to recovery of a cyber attack that resulted in a breach. It may also cover expenses for primary parties and any claims by third parties. The following are some of the reimbursable charges

1. **Investigation**- It is important to conduct a forensic investigation to gain insight on the breach or attack occurred, rectification of the same and exploring ways that could aid in prevention of such breaches in future. The services may be provided by security firms, law enforcements and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

2. **Business Losses**- Some policies may have in them errors and omissions or technical faults like network downtime. There could be business related issues like business interruption, cost and recovery of the lost data. The cyber insurance policy will cover all such losses.

3. **Privacy and Notification**- It is important to convey the customers and the affected clients of the data breach notifications. This is usually handled by law in many juris- dictions.

4. **Lawsuits and Extortion**- Confidential information and Intellectual Property are worth monetary expenses. Regulatory fines and legal settlements may also be required. Such issues are also handled by cyber risk insurance.

Thus, cyber insurance may be defined as an insurance product that may aid in protecting businesses and users from technology related risks 15. It covers liabilities related to data breach which incorporate sensitive information in form of Social Security Numbers, Credit Card numbers, health records etc.

The process of redeeming cyber insurance is fairly similar to obtaining other insurances. Usually the lifecycle follows three phases which are discussed as follows 16 .

1. Acquiring a policy- This phase constitutes of filling an application forms that covers topics related to the present security approach., protections, vulnerability and if the industry the user belongs to is targeted by cyber criminals. Based on the responses, interviews are conducted and policy terms are negotiated.

2. Claim Submission- Claims are submitted when losses take place. The policy is re- sponsible for the applicable reimbursement.

3. Policy Renewal- Once the risk profile is re-evaluated,new policy may be offered. If the offered policy is unacceptable, the process could be restarted by a different insurer.

Despite being one of the defensive techniques, cyber insurance has certain limitations. They are as follows.

1. Unavailability of advanced technology.

2. It is difficult to find solutions and map them accordingly to network attacks.

3. Improper information flow between network users, vendors and authorities does not contribute to proper network protection.

4. It is not practically possible to measure all risks and mitigate them.

5. Product vendors often play liability shell games.

6. Information asymmetry may lead to difficulty in identifying users of different types (adverse selection problem)

When placing a cyber insurance policy, some practices could be considered. They are as follows.

1. Security Investments and Cyber Insurance should complement each other since insur- ance is based on risk tolerance.

2. Engaging a well informed broker is important since the broker can comprehend cyber risks and how it is being affected by the insurance market.

3. Going beyond the application form in order to gain sufficient risk clarity that would be beneficial in obtaining maximum coverage

4. Focusing on Fair Price rather than Best Price to emphasize on uniformity and maturity.

5. Insurance terms amy be reviewed by experienced external counsel.

6. Employ cybersecurity experts to navigate through the process better.

### Digital Citizenship

The internet is a forum for a lot of activities which may also be a part of the society, politics and government, and can perpetuate cyber crimes. A digital citizen is wary of such situations and gains knowledge and skills to effectively use the internet so that cyber crimes are neither perpetuated through him, nor he is a victim to cyber attacks. A successful digital citizen has the ability to practice safe, law abiding and accountable use of the Internet by knowing their rights and responsibilities. Digital Citizenship is based on the following attributes.  

1. **Internet Security** and Privacy- It is important to protect one’s privacy over the inter- net. Certain measures could be taken to ensure internet security. The most common ways of securing oneself on internet is using passwords, not clicking on suspicious links, being wary of cyber criminals while interaction etc. Security programs and privacy settings are could be taken into consideration while using the Internet.

2. **Communication with users online**- One of the drawbacks of communicating through internet is lack of authenticity. Although there are many ways to ensure whether the person is actually who they claim to be, dealing with anonymous users may involve risk. Thus a code of conduct must be followed while communicating with online users. Also, if the users seem to be suspicious, it is advisable to pull oneself back from the situation.

3. **Cyberstalking and Cyberbullying**- Internet has also been successful in dispersing crimes like cyberstalking and cyberbullying across the globe. One of the ways to tackle the issue is to educate people around. Many a times, people are not aware of the necessary steps that must be taken once they fall victims to such crimes. It is important to educate them for same so that necessary actions could be taken at the earliest.

4. **Footprinting**- A user using the internet must be aware of the footprints they are leav- ing behind. Footprints are an excellent way for the cyber criminals to gain information about the users and the systems they use. The information could be the location, IP address, operating system etc. It is not only important to be aware of the footprints one leaves behind, but also to respect the privacy of others while tagging and posting information.

5. **Identity**- Identity may be used to express oneself digitally, hence it is an important component of digital citizenship. People may use creative texts and pictures to express themselves and this serves to be an imaginative method by which people may explore themselves.

6. **Awareness**- With cyber crimes spreading at a rampant rate, it is important to educate users about the crimes that take place over the internet. Creating awareness about credibility of websites and the advertisements featured in the webpages could be one way of imparting cybersecurity awareness.

7. **Copyrights**- A lot of information available on the internet is misused. Piracy and plagiarism are easily perpetuated online. The users must be made aware of the infor- mation that is allowed to be shared with the public and the information that is not. Using unethical means to access secured information must be discouraged.

Digital citizenship in not only restricted to the cybersecurity but also spans across var- ious other sectors encouraging digital access, digital commerce, digital communication, digital literacy, digital etiquette, digital law, digital rights and responsibilities and digital health 17.

The internet witnesses millions of users everyday, some of which are good digital citi- zens, whereas others are not. A good digital citizen performs appropriate digital security while a bad digital citizen performs inappropriate digital security. Some of the appropriate and inappropriate digital security are as follows.

1. Appropriate Digital Security  

- Using licensed software and updating it timely
- 
- Giving credit to sources
- 
- Using secure sites for communication
- 
- Displaying ethical behavior online
- 
- Not tending to unfamiliar attachments

### Information Warfare and its Countermeasures

Also referred to as cyberwarfare, electronic warfare and cyberterrorism , information war- fare is the act of causing devastation by distorting computer systems involved in significant processes like stock exchange, defense operations, telecommunications, air traffic control etc. Information warfare aims at vandalising government organizations rather than private firms or individuals. It may also involve worms, viruses and cyber attacks as a part of the mission. Cyber warriors use skills, strategies and tactics to gain sensitive information or control over computer systems. Information warrior could be launched using three tech- niques

1. Gaining unauthorised access into systems to access confidential information.

2. Deploy viruses, worms and malwares to perpetuate a cyber attack.

3. Considering loopholes in a network and exploiting them.

Information warfare being the new battlefield may lead to jamming or hijacking of broadcasting media like television, radio and internet. In the past, the results have also been in form of networks being disabled or spoofed. Stock markets have been sabotaged. With the emerging technology of drones, surveillance has become quite easy.  

 
Information warfare incorporates a series of events that take place to cause cyber attacks. It is a step by step procedure and can be presented as follows 18

1. Step 1- Gathering Information: The primary step to conduct information warfare lies in the process of gathering information about the system and the technologies involved and provides a precise model of warfare. It acts as a deciding factor since by gathering information about the target systems, cyber warriors can measure the advantages, disadvantages and outcomes of the launched attack. It also gives a rough idea about the strength and position of warriors and highlights the skills and technologies needed to hammer the target system. It is usually done by surveillance and use of sensors.

2. Step 2- Information Transport: Once enough information has been collected about the target system, the next step is to transfer this information to persons who need it in a timely manner. The communication infrastructure which supports a large number of different components plays an important role here and ensures that the information is transported in real time.

3. Step 3- Information Protection: The information captured must be protected. This in- volves two aspects of security, i.e. the physical security and the cybersecurity. Physi- cal security ensures that the information is secured physically using bullet proof cases and locks. The idea is to prevent physical destruction or interception. cybersecurity aspect deals with protecting the information using computer technologies like pass- words and encryption.

4. Step 4- Manipulating the Information: Even though multiple security layers are ap- plied to sensitive information, there may still be a slight chance that the adversary may access the information. Thus the collected information is often manipulated. The idea is that even if the information is somehow accessed by the adversary, it will be impossible to decode the original contents of the information. Several softwares can be used to manipulate texts, pictures, videos, audios and other information.

5. Step 5- Extensive Manipulation: This step is an extension to information manipulation and the idea is to prevent the adversary to get the complete and correct information. Spoofing and Noise introduction to the information degrade the quality of the infor- mation, since it is difficult to tell apart fake messages and real messages, and also hard to remove noise from the original information. Jamming may lead to denial of service, so that information may never reach its intended destination. Moreover, techniques like overloading do the same, by continuously consuming the system resources such that the system gets engaged and is unable to offer other services.

Information warfare is a serious threat. Hence protection against information warfare is compulsory. Countermeasures for information warfare lie in each and every step taken by the cyber warriors to conduct cyber attacks. The following states how information warfare can be evaded at every step.

1. Step 1- Gathering Information: To prevent the adversary from gaining sensitive in- formation, it is necessary to protect against interception and protecting information. Extensive manipulation of information using spoofing, encryption, noise introduction and overloading may serve the purpose.

2. Step 2- Information Transport: Once the information has already been collected by the adversary, it is very difficult to prevent the process of information transport. Infor- mation is transported using infrastructure, hence the only way to prevent information transport is by disrupting the infrastructure. Attacks on infrastructure components like substations, generators and pipelines would halt the information transfer. Elec- tromagnetic architecture has visible key nodes which could be easily affected. If the architecture relies on satellite communication, communication lines may be jammed.

3. Step 3- Information Protection: The countermeasure for the adversary protecting their information is quite tedious. With sophisticated cryptographic techniques, it is easier to protect information. However, the information may not likely be protected forever since high computing systems are known to break codes. If the systems are password protected, attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks could be still effective.

4. Step 4- Manipulating the Information: Only two countermeasures have proven to be successful in such a situation where an adversary manipulates information and one is supposed to get the original information. The first and the easiest way would be to intercept the information before the adversary has manipulated it. The second would be to prevent the modified data from being reintroduced to legitimate information. This information may be collected by different redundant sources with the hope that once in a while the correct information would be introduced to legitimate information flow. One can easily detect bad data from rest of the data.

5. Step 5- Extensive Manipulation: Counter Measuring such situations may need com- bination of certain skills and techniques. If the communication channel relies on frequency hopping, spread spectrum and code division multiple access (CDMA) tech- niques, it may be tedious to intercept or jam. Certain digital compression techniques when combined with redundancy lead to recovery of bit streams, despite large parts being destroyed.

### Network Neutrality

Internet service over the world differs in terms of charges, websites, methods of commu- nication ec. Network Neutrality is the principle of treating the data all over the internet as the same. This would ensure that internet is available to users across the world irrespective of the content, platform, websites, method of communication etc. The network traffic in this case is treated impartially. The idea is that operation of service at a given layer is not affected with external data and must follow protocols specific to that layer. The ser- vice providers may not be allowed to make special arrangements for certain services and websites, unlike some organizations who are beneficiary to network access and speed.

The concept of network neutrality is supported by many users and opposed by some. This is due to the fact that it carries some advantages and disadvantages, which are stated as follows

Advantages of Net Neutrality

1. It incorporates freedom of expression by allowing all blogs, services and websites to users across the world. Sometimes service providers block certain websites. Net neutrality evades that limitation.

2. It leads to an innovative and competitive environment by allowing similar access (traf- fic and speed). Usually companies and organisations benefit by customizing the in- ternet features (traffic, speed) and emerge powerful. Fast delivery to all end users will encourage competition.  

 
3. It prevents the end users from being charged extra amount to access certain services like banking, entertainment, gaming etc.

4. It is impossible for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to modify the upload and download transfers irrespective of the contents being accessed by users.

5. There is no restriction on the amount of content that can be downloaded by a particular user at a given time.

6. Net neutrality allows startups to access potential customers easily.

Disadvantages of Net Neutrality

1. Video streaming and downloads consume a lot of resources. Thus maintaining and upgrading the network becomes difficult.

2. With websites and blogs being open to all, objectionable content may be accessed by anyone and everyone. This could lead to illegal downloads and piracy practices.

3. Certain services like making calls are available on social media. This evades the need of telecom companies.

4. Network neutrality will affect the bandwidth since it is a limited commodity.

5. Anything can be posted over the internet ranging from cruel to harassing posts, mak- ing it a very toxic environment.

6. Consumers may not be able to compete against large corporations.

### Good Practices and Policies

Information Technology brings out certain changes. The age of digital transformation ensures convenience but also invites several security risks. These security risks have the potential to harm organisations both at the highest as well as the lowest levels. Thus it is mandatory that organisations introduce certain good practices and policies to ensure security in the work environment. Over the years a lot of good practices and policies have proven to be beneficial. Some of the good practices are as follows.

1. Preparedness, Prevention, Detection and Correction should be the security goals of any organisation.

2. Run security strategies from time to time, so that it is easier to choose tools when required.

3. Introduce access controls for data throughout the organization, to offer selective priv- ileges to employees for data access. This could prevent insider attacks.

4. Monitoring activities (network traffic, resources consumption and usage) leads to transparency in an organization. Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems and Intru- sion Detection Systems may prove to be highly beneficial. They can not only raise alers but also function accordingly.

5. Always have backup. A distributed environment, ensures replicated data so that af- fecting one of the data centres does not mean that data is lost. In a situation when  

 
malwares like Ransomware strike, it may be difficult to recover data, hence backup is a must.

6. Cybersecurity Awareness and Training should be encouraged in organizations. People who may not be aware of the consequences cyber attacks, may fall victim to attacks like social engineering.

7. Automating of systems should be done whenever updates are required. The updates should not depend on the approval of the user.

8. Organizations should have their sites protected using Secure Software Layer certifi- cates and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPs).

9. Insider threats should be investigated as soon as possible. Checking data logs is one way to do that.

10. Information assets should be physically secures and not only in form of replicated data over the systems and network.

11. Using multi-factor authentication to access a particular account confirms the identity of the person. A combination of what we have, what we are and what we know could prevent a lot of security issues.

12. Incident Response Plans should be devised for all organizations. In case of security breaches, organisations can rely on these plans to detect, respond and restrict the repercussions of the cyber incidents.

Cybersecurity policies are designed to protect the physical and technology assets of an organisation. Some of the cybersecurity policies highlighted in the last decade are as followws.

1. Confidential data is covert and holds value. For eg. financial information, patents, formulae for new technology, client data etc.

2. Personal and organization devices must be secured. Using passwords, antiviruses, software updates and private networks are some ways to protect such devices.

3. Emails often carry with them malwares and viruses in form of links and attachments. Employees must be made aware of such baits.

4. Password management is very crucial. Passwords should not be easy to guess, hence it is advisable to include special characters, number, uppercase and lowercase letters. They should not be written, rather remembered. If saved in a file, the file must be encrypted. Passwords should be changed once every few months.

5. When data is transferred, security risks might be introduced. Sensitive data should not be transmitted over insecure channel. It is important to ensure that the recipients are authenticated and authorized before data is transmitted.

6. Devices should be locked or turned off when unattended.

7. Illegal software must not be downloaded.  

 
### Cybersecurity and Human Rights

Cybersecurity laws and policies influence human rights, since the concept deals with pri- vacy, freedom of expression and free flow of information. In the previous section we have seen how organisations rely on practices and policies to enhance security in their institu- tion. Although introducing policies is one of the effective ways to enhance security, many policies do not produce the desired result owing to their ill definitions and lack of clear checks. This may affect their accountability, balance and mechanism thereby, violating human rights. Monitoring data is one such policy, which invades the privacy of people. Thus there arises the need to enhance security along with preserving human rights.

Certain human rights pertaining to cybersecurity are assured by the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 19. They highlight human rights in form of the following.

1. Freedom of Expression: Freedom of Expression as a human right in cybersecurity allows individuals to share their ideas through different form of communication. They may be in form of blogs, webpages, articles etc. The human right may be misused if people post inappropriate content over the network.

2. Freedom of Speech: Similar to Freedom of Expression, Freedom of Speech supports the freedom of an individual or a community, so that they can express their ideas without being retaliated by others. The human right may be misused if such groups encourage conflicts or terrorism.

3. Right to Privacy: An individual’s legal right, right to privacy ensures that a person is free from intrusion. It is possible to communicate anonymously, keeping in view that cybersecurity threats may prevail over the internet.Criminals could misuse the right such that it would be impossible to trace what they have been upto. Hence the United States Constitution does not allow Right to Privacy pertaining to cybersecurity.

4. Freedom of Association: It is the right of individuals to come together to form so- cieties, clubs and other groups to meet other individuals such that they are not in- terrupted by the government. They may express, promote and defend ideas forming unions. Over the internet, people sign petitions, join social media etc. and form asso- ciation. As long as it does not abuse public interest, this human right is acceptable.

Technological development is always ahead of human rights laws, and poses challenge to several institutions which have fewer protection in law. Technology also provides the platform to broadcast human rights. It can bring people together, encourage freedom of expression and increase access to information over the network. Keeping in mind the human aspects, it is important that human rights and technology go hand in hand.

## Future of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity as we know happens to be one of the biggest global challenges. Recent trends have highlighted how attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated with the growth of technology. Vandalising systems and patching them are red team-blue team exercises which go hand in hand. There is no way to attain cent per cent security. However it is possible to prevent security issues to certain extent and recover the lost data. Most of the patchwork methods proposed in the past have been degraded by further advanced  

 
attacks. Be it the physical systems, the networks, the cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity finds its use in almost all the domains. Several concepts like machine learning, artificial intelligence and cyber psychology are the latest addition to cybersecurity. All the stated concepts are prone to cyber attacks, thus making cybersecurity an enormous issue. Another concept that fairly makes it to the cybersecurity future is the concept of Blockchain, which we will be taking a look at in the later chapters.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have taken a look at the concept of cybersecurity at a fair depth. We are well aware of the objectives, infrastructure and architecture pertaining to cybersecu- rity. Along with that, we have acquainted ourselves with the idea of various roles in the field of cybersecurity. The need of cybersecurity arises due to the increasing cyber crimes. We have discussed traditional and contemporary cyber crimes and also specified the ways to deal with those crimes. To ensure cybersecurity in an organization, security models must be followed. We have discussed several security models, their advantages and dis- advantages. Other cybersecurity concepts like computer forensics, digital citizenship and cyber insurance have also been introduced in this chapter. We further impart the knowl- edge about network neutrality and information warfare in this chapter. Good practices and policies play a major role in securing an enterprise, which has been highlighted. Since cy- bersecurity deals with certain aspects like freedom of expressions, opinions etc., the idea of human rights also relates to cybersecurity which has also been considered.
