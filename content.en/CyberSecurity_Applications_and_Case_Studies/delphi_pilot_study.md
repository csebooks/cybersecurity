Abstract Cybercrime is becoming more and more prevalent in today’s society and attackers are

continuously discovering new methods to hack systems. Monitoring and maintaining com- puter network security is a complex process that presents unique challenges. If security is not constantly strengthened, cyber threats have the potential to affect millions of systems, all of which share similar vulnerabilities.

The issues surrounding cybercrimes are exponentially different than other types of crimes carried out in society. Therefore, federal law enforcement agencies are faced with the difficult task of generating new approaches to combat it. This chapter explores the concepts of cybercrime and cyber-security, presents the statistical impact it is having on organizations, and demonstrates the importance of an effective cyber-security policy man- ual. It also describes the methodology used for this research, analyzes the data provided by expert testimonials, and introduces the development of a new innovative technologi- cal method [Blockchain] to minimize the risk of the cyber world. The analyses cover the extent in which Blockchain applications could help strengthen cyber-security and protect organizations against cyber-attacks, and what kind of research directions are essential for the future.

## Introduction

This chapter is focused on cybersecurity policies and prevention. Cybercrimes are be- coming more prevalent in cyberspace, and organizations must take proactive measures to minimize the risk of a breach of sensitive information. In order to elicit the perceptions of cyber-security experts and gain an understanding of the industry, we collected their expert opinion about Blockchain technology and the extent to which may be a viable cybersecurity method of protection. The data was collected using the Delphi Method, which is a system- atic interactive way of gaining opinions/forecasts from a panel of independent experts. The anonymous gathering of information through surveys across a diverse population provided a more accurate and meaningful response. The Delphi method was especially useful in reducing ambiguity through the use of experts and analyzing relevant and timely issues facing the cybersecurity industry. In essence, the Delphi method has potential to provide both rigor and relevance to. The methods of analysis will be explained in-depth in the context of the report and detailed descriptions of the research tools can be found in 16. The potential contribution of this work is that it is a pilot study, with guidelines to perform a similar study on a much larger scale.

### What is Cybercrime?

Computers and Information Technology (IT) first emerged into the business world in the 1960s. Since then, cybercrime has steadily been on the rise. The cyber-security commu- nity and major news media have largely concurred on the prediction that, “Cybercrime damages will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021. This is up from $3 trillion just a year ago 12.” The rapidly evolving phenomenon, the Internet of Things (IoT) has dra- matically changed the way business is conducted. Organizations must acknowledge that the use of these new digital assets and devices for accessing them present ongoing threats to the security of critical business information. “Internet of Things refers to things having identities and virtual personalities operating in smart spaces using intelligent interfaces to connect and communicate within social, environmental, and user contexts 15.” The IoT is widening the sphere of physical security of cybersecurity, as smart devices connected to business systems via the Internet may be located outside of established secure perime- ters. As a result, this is a leading factor as to why corporate data is becoming increasingly harder to protect. IoT devices may be hacked remotely or through hardware changes if the device can be accessed, such as is the case for large exterior complexes such as chemical plants. Both the operating system and application vulnerabilities leave organizations open to attack.

Organizations today are able to spread information quicker than ever before. However, the tools and platforms that allow companies to instantaneously connect internally and externally with customers, suppliers and partners are subject to the serious risk of exposure. Not only does cybercrime significantly hinder business functions, but it can also result in serious reputational damage when not handled properly. According to a report by Forbes Insight and IBM, 46 percent of companies have suffered reputational damage due to a data breach 10. The stakes are clearly high when it comes to data breaches.

Therefore, it is vital to the success of an organization that it takes a proactive stance when it comes to preventing and combating cybercrime.  

 
### What is Cybersecurity?

In recent years, researchers and cyber-security experts have really begun to warn organi- zations that the rise in cybercrime will fundamentally change businesses policies. Ginni Rometty, IBM’s chairman, president and CEO, stated that: ”Cybercrime is the greatest threat to every company in the world.” What will it take for organizations to maximize the benefits of the various technologies available to them, while deriving methods to mitigate cybercrime risks?

Cyber-security refers to the ability to control access to networked systems and the in- formation they contain 2. When controls are effective, networks are considered to be reliable and credible digital infrastructures. However, when cyber-security controls are non-existent, incomplete, or flawed, hackers have the ability to illegally gain access to sensitive information. There are four different perimeters around a secure data asset 16

1. Physical security: area in which all critical cyber assets reside

2. System perimeter: necessary safeguards at the entrance of a privately owned network to secure it from hackers

3. Access perimeter: all of the points of physical ingress or egress through the nearest physically secured ”four-wall” boundary

4. Electromagnetic spectrum: protected global connectivity and movement within cy- berspace

Data is the heart and soul of an organization. Protecting and securing sensitive informa- tion is incredibly challenging, and when it comes to doing so, hackers have the advantage. It only takes one successful hacker to create huge damage, while it takes an organization a substantial amount of resources to prevent being hacked.

### Purpose of this Cybersecurity Pilot Study

The aim of this Cyber-Security Pilot Study is to understand cybersecurity professional’s perceptions, opinions, beliefs and attitudes regarding the effectiveness of cybersecurity initiatives. Particular focus is on control of information and the prevention of unautho- rized access at organizations. The purpose of the literature review portion is to present the statistical impact cybercrime is having on organizations, and demonstrate the impor- tance of an effective cybersecurity policy manual. Economic crime has gone digital, and when incidents occur, they attract major media attention. For example, the recent Google Docs phishing attack exposed how hackers could use Google Docs to obtain customer’s personal information. The research conducted in this case study is performed using the Delphi method, which will be explained later in the report, to determine the extent in which Blockchain applications would help to strengthen cybersecurity and protect organizations against these types of cyber-attacks.

### Methods of Cybersecurity Professionals

It is simply not possible for organizations to prevent all forms of attacks posed by hackers because of the complexity of security challenges. However, it is the responsibility of se- curity professionals to take adequate measures to plan and prepare for cyber-attack crises. Literature on the subject points out that too few individuals are employed at organizations  

 
to prevent and handle breaches 12. What separates a secure organization from the rest is one that has developed methods to detect attacks as soon as they happen, and one that has the ability to respond immediately to any incidents that occur. Cybersecurity is ex- plained in terms of three triads that describe the objectives of security professionals and their methods 2. They are:

1. Prevent, Detect and Respond

2. People, Processes, Technology

3. Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

These nine terms represent the common goals and methods common to both technology management and to cybersecurity management as a specialized field.

IT is continuously changing and hackers are constantly discovering new ways to breach defenses and exploit system weaknesses. Therefore, organizations need to understand that they have to allocate personnel to stay informed of each new potential weakness. Fed- eral governments and business entities are having an incredibly difficult time combating economic crime. Therefore, regulations and standards need to be created and modified to assist with this. It is virtually impossible for an organization to completely eliminate the vulnerabilities contained in its computer system. Therefore, they need to have an effective cybersecurity policy manual and incident response plan in place. However, it has been found that many are substantially underprepared to handle cyber threats. Additionally, studies show that many CEO’s are not even fully aware of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) policies and standards that pertain to their organizations and are crucial for effective IT governance 11.

## Shocking Statistics of Cybercrime

Business organizations are being exposed to more threats than ever and the data shows that cybercrimes are continuing to intensify. The 2016 Internet Crime Report 8 produced by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation presents valuable information for organi- zations and cyber-security professionals. Additionally, the 2016 Global Economic Crime Survey prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers 3 highlights the fundamentally flawed inci- dent response plans the majority of business organizations currently have in place.

## Role of the Internet Crime Complaint Center

Internet crime is unlike any other type of crime and presents unique challenges that are difficult to detect and deter. Therefore, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a multi-agency task force, was developed. It includes members from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The IC3’s role in helping to prevent Internet crime is best de- scribed as an intricate puzzle. Each piece is intended to fit together to effectively address the serious risk cybercrime poses to global organizations 8. The nine pieces of the puzzle, which are:

1. Detection: evidence of fraud, presence of fraud, attempt of fraud

2. Complaint: statement of distress filed by either actual victim or third party  

 
3. Mitigation: effort to stop fraud, reduce losses, and attempt recovery

4. Liaison: collaboration with all levels of Law Enforcement

5. Analysis: data that has been assessed or is available for assessment

6. Deterrence: action or events to prevent fraud through instilling fear of consequences

7. Investigation: gathering of information and conducting interviews to obtain evidence

8. Prosecution: legal action brought against the perpetrator

9. Prevention: measures to stop fraud from occurring

In 2016, there were nearly 300,000 complaints received that included over $1.33 Billion in losses 8. Comparing these figures to those from the 2015 report 8, these figures have increased by approximately five-percent from just the previous year. Additionally, the IC3’s Public Value Graph (see Figure 11.1 on the following page) illustrates that losses in monetary amounts were under $1 billion just seven years ago in 2010, and now have surpassed that mark. The bar graph shows the total number of complaints and overall victim losses for the years 2010 to 2016.

Figure 11.1 Internet Crime Complaint Center( IC3) Public Value Overall Statistics 2016

Subsequent sections of the IC3 report more specifically pertain to the purpose of this study, as they present the figures in terms of the various cybercrime types. In 2016, there were nearly 3,500 reports of a corporate data breach, almost 20,000 phishing scheme re- ports, and approximately 2,000 issues regarding currency exchange 8. In comparison, there were almost 1,000 more corporate data breach reports in 2016 than in 2015 8. These numbers corroborate the findings that cybercrime is continuing to escalate.  

 
### 2016 Global Economic Crime Survey Report

The 2016 Global Economic Crime Survey, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 3, interviewed over 6,000 organizations in 115 countries. Despite the marginal decline in economic crime reported overall, it found that Internet crime and the financial cost associated with each fraud is on the rise. With 14 percent of respondents experiencing losses of more than $1 million in the last two years, Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) need to be key players in addressing the problem 3. The survey points out that too many business organizations are not adequately bridging the gap between IT teams and senior management in terms of effective information exchange. This significantly interferes with planning for and handling of corporate data breaches. A strong relationship between the cyber-security team at a company and the CFO and other key players is crucial when serious issues such as potential security breaches are on the table. One of the problems is that these two departments speak very different “languages” and have different skill sets, which creates disconnect. It is one thing to listen to the advice from the cyber-security experts, but that advice is only useful to the extent it is acted upon. Financial information has shifted to digital channels such as Excel spreadsheets, the Cloud, servers that allow people to share docs, non-encrypted email exchange and mobile transactions. Therefore, the two departments are now highly interdependent on one another. The devastating figures presented by the IC3 and PwC clearly indicate that measures need to be taken to correct this issue. The question is, why do so many organizations have disconnects between the responsible parties and how can that be resolved?

### Inadequate Preparation at Organizations

Hackers are constantly developing new ways to initiate data leaks. Furthermore, they are able to remain on a company’s network for an extended duration without it ever being de- tected. Given the increase in the complexity of cybercrime, leaks are no longer solely an IT problem. Addressing the importance of cybersecurity starts with upper-level management at an organization and flows downward. However, the figures presented above show that more must be done to harness the intelligence of network and information security. Stake- holders must be assured of strong relationships between departments, in which information can be exchanged for investigative and intelligence purposes. Many organizations are not taking appropriate proactive measure against cyber threat. The PwC Global Economic Crime Survey found that less than 50 percent of executives even request information about their organization’s level of readiness to combat cybercrime 3. It is very despairing for stakeholders of companies to be presented with this type of information when huge corpo- rate security breaches are frequently occurring and the literature seems to indicate that not enough is being done to prevent future ones in response. It is a serious problem when only 37 percent of the organizations that responded to the PwC Global Economic Crime Survey reported to having a cybersecurity policy in place 3. If 63 percent of organizations report that they do not have a cybersecurity policy in place, this raises some serious question as to their level of awareness and ability to respond to the cyber risks at stake.

### Organizations: Be Aware, be Secure

There has to be a fundamental understanding that while using the Internet to conduct busi- ness activities has an abundance of advantages, there are serious cyber risks associated with it. It is critical that organizations consider incident handling as a core component  

 
of cyber defense, and ensure that all the necessary parties involved in protecting critical online assets are working together effectively. The reason why society knows about the cybercrime figures referenced in sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3 is that they were detected and investigated. Prevention measures taken by the IC3 will only help organizations strengthen their defenses if executives are willing to learn from previous experience. Ultimately, the aim of Internet Crime reports and surveys like the ones mentioned above is to improve the overall security of organizations and avoid costly and damaging incidents in the future. There is no universal solution to combating cybersecurity. However, policies and recom- mendation guidelines have been established to help reduce criminal activity in cyberspace. For an organization, the extent in which cybersecurity policies are effective revolves en- tirely around its Cybersecurity policy manual. The question is what policies have been set forth and what information should be included in the policy manual? The following section contains this vital information.

## Cybersecurity Policies for Organizations

The statistics that have been reviewed regarding cybercrime referenced in the previous section show that cybersecurity policy initiatives are pertinent to protect sensitive data at an organization. The word “Policy” is applied to a variety of situations that concern cybersecurity. It has been used to refer to laws and regulations concerning information distribution but is generally associated with maintaining cyber-security in today’s business world 2.

The standards and guidelines set forth by the International Organization for Standard- ization (ISO) in ISO 27001, strongly recommend that all private and public sector orga- nizations develop, implement, and maintain an appropriate cyber-security defense policy. The purpose of the ISO is to create documents that provide requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that materials, prod- ucts, processes and services are fit for their purpose 11. ISO 27001 provides best practice recommendations on information security management for use by those responsible for initiating, implementing or maintaining information security management systems 11. For an organization, its cyber-security strategy entirely revolves around a policy manual. The purpose of a written security policy is to ensure that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. Determining what information needs to be included in the policy manual and how it is validated should be a top priority of every organization. By creating a multi-layered plan to prevent cyber-attacks, an organization can substantially reduce its risk exposure.

The Cyber-security Policy Handbook 6, developed by Accellis Technology Group, suggests a four-layer framework for an organization’s policy manual. The Accellis security team has ten years of expertise with developing these types of written policies, and has created plans for the U.S. government, law firms and region-specific companies.

Their four-feature approach are in the areas of:

1. Application Security: controls within line-of-business applications such as practice management, time and billing, and accounting.

2. IT Infrastructure Security: actual devices and activities that protect against all points of ingress into the business environment.  

 
3. Education & Policy Enforcement: the creation of policies and plans that constitute the cyber-security framework, such as written security policies, incident response plan, and disaster recovery plan

4. Continual Assessment & Improvement: ongoing process for the testing of new attack vectors, the effectiveness of the CS Framework, and testing for weaknesses in the approach

Creating and carrying out policies at an organization is highly complex. Therefore, there are people and companies that solely focus on selling handbooks that contain pol- icy manual templates and consulting services to assist with this. At the basic level, these handbooks recommend defining the goals of the organization, defining roles and respon- sibilities, establishing an incident response plan, and developing and conducting continual education to reinforce the policies and controls in place 6. See 16 to review a sam- ple Applications Security and Operations Cyber-security policy manual table of contents template.

There are various elements that must be adequately addressed for an organization to effectively prevent and protect itself from cyber threats. These include components such as:

Creating a systems access policy.

Vendor compliance policy.

System management policy.

Email policy.

Encryption policy.

Password management policy.

Backup and recovery policy.

In today’s business world that has been radically transformed by the IoT, it is vital to an organization’s security over cyberspace to develop an effective policy manual. Organiza- tions should consider hiring cyber-security experts to offer their recommendations on how to create or improve their policy manuals. Whether the policy manual is written internally or with the help of a third party security company it should be written with several goals. These include:

It should define how information (and knowledge) security is accomplished within a company or enterprise including who is responsible for what.

It should inform the users that they are a part of that secure system, and that involves responsibilities on their part.

The policy manual should clearly describe what is expected of them, and the conse- quences of allowing breaches to the system.

It is also important to stress that while the goals include halting the leak of information it also includes the forensic of incidents. This means that when a security leak occurs one of the products of the investigation is a set of “Principled documents” that form the basis for litigation. All forms of personal information and Internet correspondence, both internally  

 
and externally, have value. These need to be protected, just like every other asset at the organization 11. In the survey conducted by PwC, it was found that 40 percent of CEO’s are not worried about cybersecurity, and do not even consider security standards in these areas 3. When it comes to the cybersecurity of an organization, there is no such thing as being over prepared.

### Classification of Cybersecurity at an Organization

It is helpful to consider the three-levels of security classification regarding the evaluation and monitoring of a system. There are levels A, B and C, of security evaluations. These levels are identified by their security as follows:

A: System that is mathematically proven to be secure.

B: System that has been evaluated for secure policies against best practices.

C: System that has not been evaluated.

It is inexcusable for any company or organization in today’s society to fall under a C classification with all the information available regarding the seriousness of cybercrime 5.

### Pyramid of Cyber-Security

Cyber-security can be represented as a pyramid illustrating the persistent problems with IT security, data protection and the complexity of the industry. See Figure 11.2 showing the IT and non-IT environment. At the base of pyramid are the Three Laws of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Security, the middle sections are Testing source code and creating a Reliable login, and at the top is Critical Data.

Figure 11.2 Pyramid of Cyber Security 2017

The Three Laws of Cybersecurity set rules to prevent editing files by a virus or hackers. The Three Laws of Cybersecurity, are 13:

1. The checksum of the file on the user’s device must always be the same as the check- sum of the same file by the author SW  

 
2. The network shall enable checksum verification

3. The operating system has to verify the checksum before starting an application and before using unverified system files

It is important to note that these are not exact laws in which the functions and proce- dures can be described accurately. The three laws are general rules in which to help achieve cyber-security and secure financial transactions over the Internet. To properly place secure perimeters around an operating system, all subordinates within an organization are ex- pected to modify their behavior in compliance with the policies. Analysis of the source code and strategically setting policies for user login will help protect individuals from hacking into the system. Given that this information is out there and there are tools avail- able to assist with this, it is concerning that 63 percent of organizations still do not have cyber-security policies. Organizations must take advantage of the technologies and tools available to them to achieve secure networks, such as Blockchain technology explained in the next section.

## Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is not yet mainstream, but is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records. These individual records are referred to as blocks, as more records are produced it starts to form a chain. It is anticipated to be a feasible tech solution that has the ability to transform the business ecosystem. In 2009, Bitcoin, the most prolific worldwide cryptocurrency system was introduced. It allows users to exchange currency through a decentralized system in which the integrity of the information is protected and there is complete transparency, operating independently of a central bank 18. The emergence of Blockchain is considered to be the most applicable component to come out of the introduction of bitcoin.

The underlying concept of Blockchain is that a digital, distributed transaction ledger that continuously updates its extensive list of data records, will improve the cyber-security at organizations. Blockchain is managed by a peer-to peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating newblocks. All the data for each bitcoin transaction is grouped into a block that is then placed on the Blockchain ledger. Each block is time stamped, encrypted, validated anonymously, recorded by multiple computers and permanent 1. It can be used to trace the entire path of a particular bitcoin since it was created. Once information is entered into a Blockchain, that information can never be altered or erased, which ensures its integrity and transparency. Every computer in the system has a copy of the Blockchain so that users can quickly detect any discrepancy, or signs of hacking attempts.

The key characteristics of Blockchain are:

Reliability: the system can continuously run without the fear of shutdown or interrup- tion

Transparency: all transactions are visible to every member of the Blockchain

Immutability: it is incredibly difficult to make changes to the Blockchain without detection

Irrevocability: nature of the Blockchain makes it possible for all transactions to be binding and final  

 
In the past few years, interest in Blockchain technology has substantially increased among researchers, investors and the cybersecurity community. According to Gartner’s technology hype cycle graph, Blockchain technology is at the peak of inflated expectations 1.

With all the hype surrounding Blockchain, millions of dollars are being spent by or- ganizations around the globe in order to experiment and test this new technology. Cap- ital investments into organizations providing Blockchain services have soared from only 3millionin2011tonearly500 million today 18. The ever growing excitement of Blockchain applications is a direct result of the various benefits associated with it. Some of these in- clude decentralized trust (governing principle of the network), transparency (distributed network architecture) and efficiency (transactions can be completed without an interme- diary). Its flexible design gives it the ability to not only impact financial services, but other industries as well. A few of the primary potential industries include Smart Contracts, Automated Auditing, and the one featured in this pilot study, Cybersecurity. Cybersecu- rity has the ability to be vastly strengthened because the nature of the Blockchain enables the immediate detection of data manipulation and verifies the integrity of IT systems 18. However, the literature indicated that there is currently still a lot of uncertainty associated with the technology. Challenges such as regulation and scalability are currently holding up mainstream adoption. Cyber-security experts are currently in the process of performing the necessary research and testing protocols so that Blockchain is ready for adoption in the near future. Just imagine the endless possibilities that could result from this technology if organizations choose to incorporate it into the cybersecurity policy manuals.

## Research Methodology

This section describes the pilot study proposition, research perspective, study design, and procedures followed. The focus of this research is to interpret and analytically disclose the opinions of the human subjects regarding the cybersecurity industry.

The focus is on expert opinions regarding cybersecurity and the future of Blockchain applications. The primary goal is to develop a survey instrument that captured the testi- monials of expert insight on cybersecurity policies and initiatives. Based on the literature review portion of this Cybersecurity Pilot Study, it was identified that Blockchain technol- ogy has the potential to be a viable solution for improving the security of the Internet. But do the experts agree with this proposition? The respondents to the survey were recruited from various backgrounds, with highly regarded credentials. The researcher sought to dis- cover the extent to which experts believed Blockchain applications could revolutionize the business world.

### Quantitative and Qualitative Data Collection

The research conducted for the study reported here, applies a Delphi style survey. A combi- nation of quantitative scales and qualitative open-ended responses are utilized to collect the information. The primary information is obtained through the survey that is distributed to elicit the anonymous opinions of the experts, after requesting permission to do so (see 16 for details of the survey). The secondary information is compiled from a variety of sources including literature, journals and articles. The Delphi Method originated in the American business community, and has since been widely accepted globally in many industry sec- tors including health care, defense, business, education, and information technology 17.  

 
One of the unique values of the Delphi method is that it facilitates a dialog that shares knowledge and considerations among participants as they work toward a collaborative re- sponse to the questions. The net result of this is that that in the majority of uses of the Delphi method, the group’s results are better than that of most participants. Therefore, it is believed that as knowledge engineering systems evolve which are used in global collab- orative projects, the Delphi style survey will play an important part of working towards consensus. It is used in this Cyber-Security Pilot Study to collect and analyze the opinions of cyber-security experts using a survey interspersed with feedback.

### Design of the Study

The design of this study is based on deductive reasoning. A deductive approach is applied, which means that a hypothesis was developed from an existing proposition and then a research strategy was designed to test the hypothesis. Information is collected from cyber- security experts regarding the following hypothesis.

H1: Use of Blockchain applications will help to strengthen cyber-security and protect organizations against cyber-attacks.

The target population of this research is comprised of cyber-security experts, which is defined as individuals who work(ed) in cyber-security or a related IT field for a minimum of three years. This information was part of the Screening Questions, as listed in Ex- pert Respondent Sufficiency & Qualifications, 16. The sample consists of professionals that work in the industry with jobs relating to cybersecurity policy initiatives, and devel- oping technologies available to protect organizations from cyber threats. Ten potential respondents recruited from networking events, university connections and LinkedIn were approached via a carefully crafted email see 16 for the survey invitation. At the end of the invitation, participants who wished to have the results of the pilot study shared with them had the option to provide an email address. Prior to participating in the Online Cy- bersecurity Survey, the eight respondents were ensured of their complete anonymity.

### Selection of the Delphi Method

The original Delphi method was developed by Norman Dalkey of the RAND Corporation in the 1950’s for a U.S. sponsored military project. The method entails a group of experts who anonymously reply to surveys and subsequently receive feedback in the form of a statistical representation of the ”group response,” after which the process repeats itself 17. The goal for this pilot study is to reduce the range of responses and arrive at something closer to expert consensus. It was chosen as an effective methodology for this query of experts and stakeholders because of the following reasons:

1. The complexity of the cybersecurity industry requires knowledge from individuals who understand the different economic, social and political implications.

2. It does not require the experts to be present physically, which would have been im- practical for this study.

3. The Delphi method size requirements are modest. The method can be utilized with as few as two respondents 14.

The sample size of this study contained eight expert respondents. Within the scope and time limitations of this pilot study, this sample size was considered commendable. It is  

 
important to bear in mind that this is a pilot study; the aim is to test the format and provide the feasibility for a much larger version.

### Procedure of Utilization of the Delphi Method

The procedure undertaken by the researcher involves three general steps:

1. Brainstorming of related questions

2. Distributing a series of quantitative and qualitative questions to qualified experts

3. Narrowing in on the scope and quality of the responses by means of second round open-ended questions

The Delphi survey was created using the Google Forms online survey application that is directly accessible via a one-click link shared by email. This has the added benefit that the data is directly collected and stored in digital format, thus saving the researcher time and resources. Furthermore, it reduces the chance of transcription errors that are common to collecting data with the traditional pen and paper format. Another added benefit of this delivery method is that the respondents were free to use whichever response platform was most convenient such as laptop, IPad/tablet or smartphone, thus reducing obstacles in answering the survey. And finally, another advantage of this is that it speeds up the turnaround time between iterations of the Delphi Method. This is an important success factor in terms of scalability of this study, i.e. so that they study can be performed with a larger number of respondents in the future.

In terms of this pilot study, the purpose of the first round is to gain a basic understand- ing of the respondents’ perceptions of cyber-security practices at organizations through multiple quantitative and qualitative survey questions. In the second round, each Delphi participant receives another series of open-ended questions to respond to and is asked to review the key findings summarized by the researcher based on the information provided in the first round. After this is completed, a general inductive approach is taken by the researcher. The objectives are to establish a link between the research proposition and the findings provided the respondents, and to condense the qualitative data into a brief summary format. In response to this challenge, the researcher categorizes and codes the qualitative data to hopefully achieve the desired level of consensus. It is important to note that theoretically the Delphi process can be continuously iterated when it is determined that additional iterations beyond three are needed or valuable, given more time and resources. For this study, three rounds was considered sufficient for a pilot, as proof-of concept, given the time limitations. Below provides the specific information that pertain to each round.

### Delphi Activities [Iteration Rounds] of this Pilot Study

1. Round #1: Initial collection. The first survey is distributed on the same day that the expert agrees to serve as a respondent to the survey. The survey contains a series of varying complexity level questions, each corresponding to the research proposition. The researcher requests permission to collect richer data by means of second round open-ended follow-up questions. After gaining approval, this leads to the second round of the Delphi Method.

2. Round #2: Richer data collection. The Delphi study is flexible in its design, which allows for the second round of follow-up questions in this study. The goal is to un- derstand the importance and narrow in on the scope of the responses based on the  

 
differing perspectives. The respondents are asked to review the key findings compiled by the researcher based upon the responses provided in Round #1. As a result, this provides more concise and richer data because of an additional iteration and partici- pant response revision due to feedback.

3. Final analysis. The goal of the final phase of the study is to reach a consensus and analyze the major themes to see as to whether or not the research proposition in this pilot study is validated. The researcher uses information provided in both the first and second round to categorize, code, and identify themes among the responses.

This Cyber-Security Pilot Study 16, is exploratory in nature. It aims to explore a topic in which the research proposition being evaluated has no clear, single set of outcomes. It involves incrementally developing deep understanding through the collection of multiple types of data about the complex issues organizations in today’s business world face with regards to cybercrime.

The aim of the research is the inquiry into cyber security experts’ perceptions, opin- ions, beliefs and attitudes towards organizations implementing Blockchain technology to prevent against cyber-attacks. There is a combination of questions, some using the Likert Scale. The rating scale (1-5) ranged from 1- Strongly Disagree to 5- Strongly Agree. The remaining questions solicit a series of short responses (Refer to 16). Through the series of open-ended questions, the experts focused’ on severaldifferent topics: Cyber-security Gov- erning Policies, Cybersecurity at Organizations, Cybercrime Prevention, and Blockchain Technology.

## Results of the Cybersecurity Delphi Study

The results were collected over a period of four weeks, and vary in type with each round. The first round was primarily focused on individual brainstorming function as the experts responded to a series of questions regarding cyber-security policy and protection. After gaining a fundamental understanding of the expert opinions, the researcher carefully or- ganized the data to look for patterns in the responses. In the second round, findings from the first round were presented to the respondents and they were asked to open-endedly re- spond to four key insights. The final round required the researcher to code and categorize the textual responses to the openended questions, ultimately looking for common themes.

### Result from Round One

In the first round, eight experts responded to a series of quantitative and qualitative ques- tions relating to cybersecurity and Blockchain technology. Four distinct findings emerged from the experts in round one. These are described below.

**11.6.1.1 Expert Level Awareness of Cyber-Security** 62.5% respondents are ”Very aware” of cybersecurity and the remaining 37.5% are Mod-

erately aware (see Figure 11.3). Therefore, the researcher sought to investigate what each expert would recommend in regards to creating a cybersecurity policy.

**11.6.1.2 Cyber Incident Response Plan** As shown in Figure 11.4, 75% of 8 respondents either Strongly Disagree or Disagree that

the majority of organizations have an effective cyber incident response plan. Therefore, the researcher sought to determine what each expert believes should be done to correct this.

**11.6.1.3 Federal Government Cybersecurity Initiatives** As shown in Figure 11.5, 62.5% of respondents believe that federal governments need

to improve cyber-security initiatives. Therefore, the researcher sought to examine what measures governments should take in this regard.

**11.6.1.4 Blockchain Secure Internet Transactions** 75% of respondents believe that using a technology like Blockchain is a more secure  

 
method than using intermediaries to complete Internet transactions (See Figure 11.6 below and in Reitmeier, 2017). Therefore, the researcher sought to determine why Blockchain would or wouldn’t help to strengthen an organization’s cyber-security policy manual.

### Results of Round Two

Six of the initial round respondents agreed to participate in the second round of open-ended questions. For the second round, the major findings from Round 1 were summarized and the four key insights were presented to the respondents (see Table 11.6.2). The findings were revealed via email to the six respondents who agreed to review the updated survey statements.

Table 11.1 The major findings from Round 1 and the 4 key insights presented to the respondents.

The top four findings were structured into open-ended questions for the experts to re- spond to (see for more detailReitmeier (2017) and these were sent to them via email. The experts were asked to be as specific as possible answering the following questions:

1. If you were (or are) in charge of setting the cyber-security policy at the organization you work for, what would you do, specifically, to reduce the vulnerability of online data and protect data integrity?

2. What should be done to encourage and/or mandate organizations to create and imple- ment an effective cyber incident response plan?  

 
3. What measures should be taken by federal governments to improve cyber-security standards?

4. Please provide justification as to why you believe or do not believe the use of Blockchain applications would help to strengthen the cyber-security policy manual at an organi- zation.

The feedback from the open-ended questions are noted in Tables 11.6.2 to 11.6.2. Re- sponses were categorized and coded so that the major themes could be identified and cat- egorized by the researcher. The full expert responses used for the inductive analysis is provided in the appendices of 16.

After the findings were categorized and coded, it allowed for the themes to be identified. The following section highlights the key themes that emerged from the research.

Question #1: If you were in charge of setting the cyber-security policy for an organiza- tion, what would you do, specifically, to reduce the vulnerability of online data and protect data integrity?

Five different themes developed from this question, and are presented below:

1. Determine specific cyber-security requirements pertaining to that organization. Then survey commercial policy handbook vendors to implement policy.

2. Strong authentication and verification of all executives, employees, and stakeholders is critical. This includes a multifactor and multilayer authentication.

3. It is important that continuous monitoring occurs on a daily basis. This includes system management (ensuring firewall protection) and hardware and software be up- todate and reviewed.

4. Allocate the necessary resources to creating and validating a cyber-security policy manual and hire the right people to enforce it.

5. Training on security fundamentals.

Question #2: What should be done to encourage and/or mandate organizations to cre- ate and implement an effective cyber incident response plan?

Three themes developed from this question, and are presented below:

1. Maintain relationships with key external stakeholders, such as law enforcement.

2. Enact legislation that establishes new cyber-security assessment model.

3. It needs to be a cooperative effort to increase the awareness of the seriousness of cybercrimes and the potential they have to impact organizations.

Survey respondent Z is quoted of saying, Professional associations should be encour- aged to develop approaches that are beneficial to all members. This would reduce costs and aggregate risk analysis across the group.

Question #3: What measures should be taken by federal governments to improve cyber- security standards?

Three themes developed in response from the experts in relation to the third question.  

 
1. New communication protocols need to be established and enforced such as encryption of communication devices.

2. The SIPRnet approach needs to be modified and adapted for use within the U.S.

3. Current commerce functions and future systems (such as VR) need to be modified by government authorities.

Two of the experts summarized the scope of the question copiously. The responses mentioned that the Department of Homeland Security has to become more involved and should be encouraged to work with industry to develop robust approaches to corporate security.

Question #4: Please provide justification as to why you believe or do not believe the use of Blockchain applications would help to strengthen the cyber-security policy at an organization.

Five major themes developed from the final question.

1. Blockchain technologies do have many important advantages. These include effi- ciency, transparency, reliability, and quick detection of attempted hack.

2. More research & testing is necessary.

3. The existing Internet commerce mechanism will need either major modification or replacement to take advantage of Blockchain features.

4. Currently, there are no standards for crypto-currency.

5. Governments worldwide are in the process of creating regulatory policies for the ap- plication.

### Discussion and Limitations Based on the Results

Reflecting on these themes, it is evident that measures need to be taken to address the fact that many organizations in today’s business world are vastly underprepared when it comes to their cyber-security policy manual. Cybersecurity policies has been sidelined in the rush to gain market share and a competitive advantage over rival organizations. As noted above, it needs to be a cooperative effort to increase the awareness of the seriousness of cybercrimes and the potential they have to impact organizations.

The most common finding in this pilot study is that the majority of organizations do not have an effective cyber-security policy manual to refer to. Furthermore, the ones that do, are not properly enforcing it. It is crucial that an organization monitors its network security system on a daily basis, to not only reduce vulnerabilities, but also to minimize the threat of being hacked. Ongoing cyber-security training is vital to the success of an organization. It allows for all employees to be up to date on the current policies in place and their role and responsibility if an incident does occur.

There is a tendency at organizations to suggest solutions that do not consider the com- plexity of the issue of cybercrime in its entirety. However, technologies are emerging that have a broad potential future and which do not require organizations to build their own system in house, such as Blockchain. Blockchain applications offer interesting tools to facilitate the process of transferring sensitive information. The Blockchain design is cryp- tographically secure, extremely hard to change without permitted access, and updatable only with consensus among all parties in the chain. Those organizations that have realized  

 
they need to take their cyber-security policies seriously have taken an interest in the tech- nology and are investing in its R&D and testing. Blockchain may possess the ability to radically change and enhance the business world at a fundamental level because every 10 minutes, all transactions conducted are verified, cleared, and stored in a block.

There were some issues raised in this pilot study that were unexpected. Although this pilot study reached its aims, there were some unavoidable limitations and shortcomings. First of all, the research was conducted in a one month period. Four weeks is not enough to do justice to and fully understand cyber security experts’ perceptions, opinions, beliefs and attitudes towards cyber-security policies at organizations. The results would have been more conclusive if the method had been applied over a longer timeframe.

Second, the sample size of the respondent group is small. Only eight respondents might not represent the majority of the experts in the cyber-security industry. Additionally, the first round initial survey, was designed to gain a basic understanding of cyber-security policies and protection mechanisms at organizations. However, it seemed to not provide enough evidence of the impact cybercrimes are having on organizations. In addition to this, two of the eight respondents dropped out after the first round. This hinders the Delphi Method process, and reduced the sample size of the second round collection of richer data. The intent of the Delphi Method is to properly analyze the expert’s statements regarding cyber-security. Therefore, the results are more reliable if multiple iterations are able to be conducted. Despite these limitations, the pilot study research presented key insight into cyber-security policies and the future of Blockchain technology. A recommendation for a larger scale study of this type is to offer an incentive for respondents who are willing and able to participate in every iteration round. Doing so, would potentially attract the attention of more experts and increase the likelihood that respondents don’t drop out.

Ultimately, there are new technologies becoming available that offer the ability to strengthen the cybersecurity policy at an organization. The experts in this study concurred that, cur- rently, too many organizations do not have an effective or validated cybersecurity policy manual. Data is the critical dependency of organizations worldwide, and protecting the in- tegrity of it needs to be of top priority. There is no advantage to waiting for the government to take action, it is the responsibility of the organization to strengthen its cyber-security policies. There are an endless stream of practical benefits that flow from Blockchain tech- nologies. However, it is important to be aware of the challenges and risks involved of adopting the technology.

## Conclusion

Cybercrime has become a global phenomenon, and as shown, is immensely disrupting to the world of business. As the Internet of Things, Virtual and Augmented reality, and Artifi- cial Intelligence continue to advance, organizations will be fundamentally revolutionized. They will face serious challenges while trying to adapt and optimize the integration of these new technologies with employees, and the cyber-security policies at the organization. Ac- cording to Edward Hess, a top authority on organizational and human high performance at the University of Virginia, organizations are expected to undergo critical transformations 9. They are in four areas:

Technology: integrating new technologies and data analytics into every part of the organization

Systematic Redesign: creating a technology-enabled Human Excellence System  

 
Leadership: developing a new model of how to lead and manage others

Human Resource: transforming human resources functions into human development functions

As a result, measures must be taken to overcome the challenges the transformations present and keep the threats they pose to the cyber-security at the organization to the bare minimum. Hess stated that, The Smart Machine Age will be more disruptive than the Industrial Revolution because of its scope, scale, and the power and quality of what the technology can do (Hess, 2017). Consequently, to protect e-commerce transactions and increase economic gains through cyberspace, continuous research is needed to control and prevent the associated cybercrime activities. The literature in the cyber-security field is aimed to discover the truth behind cybercrime, expose the alarming statistics, and point out that many organizations have fundamentally flawed cyber-security policy manuals or do not have one at all.

### The Literature in the Field

The fact that the information is becoming mainstream regarding cyber-security is highly beneficial, as it is intended to alert organizations around the globe that each and every day they face the serious risk of being targeted. It is vital to the success of an organization to fully accept the fact that cybercrime is on the rise, and therefore they must utilize the prevention technologies available to assist with maintaining security and protecting its sys- tems and sensitive information. The extent in which a cyber-security policy is effective at an organization, is highly dependent on its cyber-security policy manual. If an organiza- tion adopts the policy manual suggestions and protection technologies available to it, it is offered the opportunity to stay a step ahead of an attack.

There is a severe lack of monitoring mechanisms and skilled personnel in cyber-security in the business world. Additionally, rapidly evolving environment complexity, continuous new threats and exploits, and not properly allocating budgets for security initiatives is addressed in the literature 7. The skills required for hackers to gain access to sensitive information is diminishing, and the hacking techniques are increasing in sophistication. As a result, everyone, from your next door neighbor to an individual or organization located across the globe, is a potential threat. It is incredibly difficult to understand the complexity of the cyber-security industry, as cybercrimes are continuing to escalate and new methods are constantly being developed. Therefore, staying up to date on the research and testing pertaining to cyber threats is crucial.

### Next Steps for Future Research

There is a high anticipation that Blockchain technology will have the ability to transform the way business is conducted. Arvind Krishna, senior vice president at IBM Research, stated that 4:

Over the past two decades, the internet has revolutionized many aspects of business and society Blockchain could bring to those processes the openness and efficiency we have come to expect in the internet era.

Further investigation of Blockchain is necessary, but there is a growing expectancy that it will be extremely beneficial for organizations. It is predicted to considerably reduce the probability of an organization being hacked, and substantially improve its cybersecurity. Although predictions can be made, there is no way of knowing exactly what the future  

 
has in store for the cyber-security industry. One can only hope that within the next few years, technologies such as Blockchain will undergo the necessary testing phases, and that organizations begin to implement strong encryption technology to secure their data.

Future research is highly recommended to address the question: “How can cyber- security experts piece together the information and technologies available to make cy- berspace more secure than it is currently?” Pilot studies like the one in this account do not have the ability to eliminate cybercrime, nor can they guarantee cybersecurity for all. How- ever, continuous research in the field will inspire innovative and progressive thinking, and create a world where more organizations are conscious of their cybersecurity initiatives. When society as a whole becomes willing and enabled to take adequate action against cyber threats, the Internet will become a better and safer place to conduct business.
